# Introduction

The regulation of gene expression is one of the fundamental topics in Genetics.
In this session we will learn about transcription factors (TF), which are proteins that bind specifically to DNA sequences called cis-regulatory elements. Binding affects the expression of nearby genes. Furthermore, we will see how regulatory elements can be discovered in promoter sequences using statistical tests. By aligning the sequence of cis elements bound by the same TF is is possible to build a **DNA motif**.

# Protein-DNA recognition

DNA-binding proteins contain DNA-binding domains and have a specific or general affinity for either single or double stranded DNA. Here we will concentrate mostly on transcription factors, which generally recognize cis-regulatory elements in double-stranded DNA molecules.

## Dissecting a protein-DNA interface

Transcription factors recognize target DNA sequences through a binding interface, composed of protein residues and DNA stretches in intimate contact.
The best descriptions of protein-DNA interfaces are provided by structural biology, usually by X-ray or NMR experiments.

![Cartoon dissection of the interface of a NarL dimer (PDB entry 1JE8)](pics/interface_movie.gif) 

## Atomic interactions between protein and DNA residues

The process of recognition of DNA sequences by proteins involves readout mechanisms, and also accessory stabilizing atomic interaction that do not confer specificty.

**Direct readout** 

* Hydrogen bonds: direct + water-mediated
* Hydrophobic interactions

**Indirect readout**

* Sequence-specific deformation of DNA base steps

**Stabilizing interactions**

* Not sequence-specific, involving DNA backbone

## Direct readout: hydrogen bonds

![Donor and acceptor hydrogen bond atoms in nitrogen bases, from @Luscombe2001](pics/bases-groove-HB.jpg) 

## Direct readout: Van der Waals interactions

![DNA bases display VdW interactions involving mainly C atoms, from @Luscombe2001](pics/bases-VW.gif)

![Sequence-specific VdW interactions involve fundamentally thymine-C5M group, adapted from @Luscombe2001](pics/bases-groove-VW.jpg)

## Indirect/shape readout

Besides atomic interactions between protein and DNA, sequence-dependent deformability of duplexes, deduced from crystal complexes, implies that sequence recognition also involves DNA shape.

![DNA step geometry descriptors, from @Lu2008](pics/bp_step_hel.png)

DNA deformation is described by the increase in energy brought about by instantaneous fluctuations of the step parameters from their equilibrium values:

$deformation = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^6 \displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^6 spring_{ij} \Delta\theta_{i,st} \Delta\theta_{j,st}$ (@Olson1998)

![Roll and twist of DNA steps are different for purine and pyrimidine steps, from @Olson1998](pics/roll-twist-steps.jpg)

The accumulation of experimental and molecular dynamics data of DNA molecules currently supports predictive algorithms, such as [DNAshape](http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/DNAshape/), which predict the geometry of DNA sequences:  

![Geometry descriptors of a DNA duplex by sliding a sequence window, from @Zhou2013. MGW=Major Groove Width.](pics/DNApentamers.jpg)

## Protein-DNA interface graphs

Interfaces can be explored as generic bipartite graphs (@Sathyapriya2008) or with sub-graphs that focus only on specific sequence recognition:

# Comparison of DNA-binding proteins

A great variety of DNA-binding proteins has been observed in nature, which can be analyzed and compared in terms of the features introduced above, such as readout, or instead with an evolutionary or topological perspective.  

![Example HTH transcription factors from the work of @Luscombe2000](pics/DNAbinding-classes.jpg)

The  [Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP)](http://scop.berkeley.edu) systematically groups protein folds in superfamilies, of which some are the most common DNA-binding proteins. The next table shows superfamilies with more than 20 non-redundant complexes in the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org) as of May, 2018, as annotated in the database [3d-footprint](http://floresta.eead.csic.es/3dfootprint/):

SCOP superfamily | Number of complexes
---------------- | -------------------
Winged helix (WH) | 95
Homeodomain-like (H) | 66
Glucocorticoid-receptor-like (GR) | 38
Restriction endonuclease-like (RE) | 24 
Homing endonuclease (HE) | 32 
p53-like (P53) | 23
Lambda-repressor-like (LR) | 23

## Analysis of protein-DNA interfaces in transcription factors families

The available experimental structures of protein-DNA complexes in the PDB support the annotation of interface residues, those involved directly in sequence recognition, within protein families.

![Annotation of interface residues by transference from PDB complexes in the footprintDB database](pics/intf-annot-hist.png)

Several examples in the literature have demonstrated the correlation between interface patterns and the bound DNA motifs within large transcription factor families, such as the work of @Noyes2008:

![Relation between (annotated) interface residues and cognate DNA motifs or homeobox transcription factors, from @Noyes2008.](pics/homeo-intf.png)

<!--Structural data are key for the study of interfaces, as well as the structural superposition of DNA-binding domains:
![Alignment and superposition of 35 C2H2/C2HC zinc finger domains. (A) Structure-based multiple sequence alignment with summary of interface residues at the bottom. (B) Backbone cartoon of the corresponding structural superposition. (C) Summary of four side chain rotamer clusters found for interface residues aligned in column 20 of the multiple alignment, from @ContrerasMoreira2010b.](pics/ZFintf.png) -->

The study of interfaces must be done in the appropriate biological context, for instance considering the oligomerization state of TFs _in vivo_, as each family of transcription factors has singularities, such as these (compiled by Álvaro Sebastián):

Family | Motifs | Multimeric | Multidomain
------ | ------ | ---------- | -----------
Homeodomain	| TAATkr,TGAyA | Sometimes | Unusual
Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)	| CACGTG,CAsshG	| Always (homodimers, heterodimers)	| Never
Basic leucine zipper (bZIP)	| CACGTG,-ACGT-,TGAGTC | Always (homodimers, heterodimers) | Never
MYB	| GkTwGkTr | Common (multimers)	| Common
High mobility group (HMG)	| mTT(T)GwT,TTATC,ATTCA | Sometimes	| Unusual
GAGA | GAGA	| Never	| Never
Fork head	| TrTTTr | Unusual | Never
Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster |	CGG	| Common (homodimers) | Never
Ets	| GGAw | Common (homodimers, heterodimers, multimers)	| Never
Rel homology domain (RHD) |	GGnnwTyCC |	Always (homodimers, heterodimers)	| Never
Interferon regulatory factor | AAnnGAAA	| Always (homodimers, heterodimers, multimers) |	Never

## Aligning cis elements by superposition of atomic coordinates of interfaces 

Here I briefly describe a structural alignment approach for the comparison of DNA-binding proteins and their interfaces, as discussed in @Siggers2005 and @Sebastian2013. In this context superpositions might guide the correct alignment of cis elements bound by homologous proteins, as illustrated in the figure.

![Sequence and structue alignment of cis-elements bound by two homologous PDB complexes: 3A01_A1 and 1FJL_B1. Note that this optimal sequence alignment does not match equivalent interface positions, adapted from @Sebastian2013.](pics/TFcompare.png)

## Specificity-based classification of DNA-binding proteins

DNA motifs inferred from protein-complexes can be analyzed in terms of their information content:

![Information content of structure-derived DNA motifs of proteins belonging to several SCOP superfamilies as of May, 2018, after @ContrerasMoreira2010](pics/superfam_specificity.png)

# Discovering cis elements in genomes by counting words ($k$-mers)

Now that we know how transcription factors recognize their target DNA sites, we will how learn how enrichment of DNA words in upstream gene promoter sequences can be computed in order to discover putative regulatory elements. We will follow the method of @vanHelden1998.

For this demo some data files are required, as well as some R functions, which you can download from [https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/methods_biostats_bioinfo](https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/methods_biostats_bioinfo/archive/master.zip) or with *git*:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
# if you don't have this yet
#git clone https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/methods_biostats_bioinfo.git
cd methods_biostats_bioinfo
git pull
```

After this is done, you'll have the required data and code. Let's have a look at the data:

```{r oligoinput, engine='bash'}
# a set of upstream sequences of a group of co-regulated genes on Brachypodium distachyon
# see that they have been cut with coordinates -1000,+200 with respect to 
# transcription start site (TSS)
head test_data/regulon.raw.fna
echo

# same sequences but repeat-masked
head test_data/regulon.rm.fna
echo

# frequency of hexamers in those raw upstream sequences computed with RSAT  
# oligo-analysis -v 1 -seqtype dna -l 6 -return occ,freq -quick -str 2 -ovlp -sort
head -35 test_data/6nt_upstream_regulon.raw.tab | grep -v ";"
echo

# frequency of hexamers in the repeat-masked sequences 
head -35 test_data/6nt_upstream_regulon.rm.tab | grep -v ";"
echo

# frequency of hexamers in all (rm) upstream sequences of that genome
head -35 test_data/6nt_upstream_genome.tab | grep -v ";"
```

Now let's inspect the R code which will be used in this demo. We'll start by checking the function that computes the significance of hexamers:

```{r oligofunction, eval=FALSE}

                                       prob = oligo.table$obs_freq_background, lower.tail=TRUE, log=TRUE)
  
  ## Two-sided test
  oligo.table$pval <- pmin(oligo.table$pval.under, oligo.table$pval.over) * 2
  oligo.table$log.pval <- pmin(oligo.table$log.pval.under, oligo.table$log.pval.over) * 2
  
  ## Compute the E-value (multiple testing correction).`
  ##  E-value indicates the expected number of false positives 
  ## (i.e. how many oligos would be expected to be be declared positive under 
  ## the null hypothesis)
  oligo.table$eval <- oligo.table$pval * nb.oligos
  
  ## Compute the significance
  ## sig = -log10(eval)
  oligo.table$sig <- -log10(nb.oligos) - oligo.table$log.pval/log(10)
  
  ## Compute maximal frequency for both files
  max.axis <- max(c(oligo.table$obs_freq_query, oligo.table$obs_freq_background))
  
  ## Log2 ratio observed/expected
  oligo.table$freq.ratio <- oligo.table$obs_freq_query/oligo.table$obs_freq_background
  oligo.table$log2.ratio <- log2(oligo.table$freq.ratio)
  
  return(oligo.table)
}
```

Now we shall look at the plotting function:

With this data and functions we can now compute $k$-mer enrichment in the promoters of a sample set of co-regulated genes or **regulon**:

![Cluster of co-expressed genes](pics/cluster_expression.png)

```{r demooligo}

# adjust as required

source(file.path(dir_code, "kmer_stats.R"))

# set word/k-mer size

# set files with pre-computed words/k-mer frequencies

oligo.genome.freq.file = file.path(dir_data, "6nt_upstream_genome.tab")
 
# check the code of this function to see how the probabilities of word occurrences 
# are computed with the binomial function

                               background.oligo.file = oligo.genome.freq.file)
#View(kmer.stat.table)
  
plot.kmers(kmer.stat.table, k, volcano.ymax = 60)
