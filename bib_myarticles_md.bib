   Abstract = {We present a model of the yeast exosome based on the bacterial degradosome component polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Electron microscopy shows the exosome to resemble PNPase but with key differences likely related to the position of RNA binding domains, and to the location of domains unique to the exosome. We use various techniques to reduce the many possible models of exosome subunits based on PNPase to just one. The model suggests numerous experiments to probe exosome function, particularly with respect to subunits making direct atomic contacts and conserved, possibly functional residues within the predicted central pore of the complex.},

   Abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are central to most biological processes. Although much recent effort has been put into methods to identify interacting partners, there has been a limited focus on how these interactions compare with those known from three-dimensional (3D) structures. Because comparison of protein interactions often involves considering homologous, but not identical, proteins, a key issue is whether proteins that are homologous to an interacting pair will interact in the same way, or interact at all. Accordingly, we describe a method to test putative interactions on complexes of known 3D structure. Given a 3D complex and alignments of homologues of the interacting proteins, we assess the fit of any possible interacting pair on the complex by using empirical potentials. For studies of interacting protein families that show different specificities, the method provides a ranking of interacting pairs useful for prioritizing experiments. We evaluate the method on interacting families of proteins with multiple complex structures. We then consider the fibroblast growth factor/receptor system and explore the intersection between complexes of known structure and interactions proposed between yeast proteins by methods such as two-hybrids. We provide confirmation for several interactions, in addition to suggesting molecular details of how they occur.},

   Abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

   Volume = {320},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {751-770.},
   Abstract = {Several models have been proposed to explain the origin and evolution of enzymes in metabolic pathways. Initially, the retro-evolution model proposed that, as enzymes at the end of pathways depleted their substrates in the primordial soup, there was a pressure for earlier enzymes in pathways to be created, using the later ones as initial template, in order to replenish the pools of depleted metabolites. Later, the recruitment model proposed that initial templates from other pathways could be used as long as those enzymes were similar in chemistry or substrate specificity. These two models have dominated recent studies of enzyme evolution. These studies are constrained by either the small scale of the study or the artificial restrictions imposed by pathway definitions. Here, a network approach is used to study enzyme evolution in fully sequenced genomes, thus removing both constraints. We find that homologous pairs of enzymes are roughly twice as likely to have evolved from enzymes that are less than three steps away from each other in the reaction network than pairs of non- homologous enzymes. These results, together with the conservation of the type of chemical reaction catalyzed by evolutionarily related enzymes, suggest that functional blocks of similar chemistry have evolved within metabolic networks. One possible explanation for these observations is that this local evolution phenomenon is likely to cause less global physiological disruptions in metabolism than evolution of enzymes from other enzymes that are distant from them in the metabolic network.},

   Abstract = {PRINTS is a database of protein family 'fingerprints' offering a diagnostic resource for newly-determined sequences. By contrast with PROSITE, which uses single consensus expressions to characterise particular families, PRINTS exploits groups of motifs to build characteristic signatures. These signatures offer improved diagnostic reliability by virtue of the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. To date, 800 fingerprints have been constructed and stored in PRINTS. The current version, 17.0, encodes approximately 4500 motifs, covering a range of globular and membrane proteins, modular polypeptides, and so on. The database is accessible via the UCL Bioinformatics World Wide Web (WWW) Server at http://www. biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/ . We have recently enhanced the usefulness of PRINTS by making available new, intuitive search software. This allows both individual query sequence and bulk data submission, permitting easy analysis of single sequences or complete genomes. Preliminary results indicate that use of the PRINTS system is able to assign additional functions not found by other methods, and hence offers a useful adjunct to current genome analysis protocols.},

   Abstract = {Genome sequencing projects are producing linear amino acid sequences, but full understanding of the biological role of these proteins will require knowledge of their structure and function. Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high- resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes. We then discuss the important role that protein structure prediction methods play in the growing worldwide effort in structural genomics.},

In all cases, the models derived capture the important statistical characteristics of the family and can be used for a number of tasks, including multiple alignments, motif detection, and classification.

The reasons for such a high ratio of modeling from single parents only are discussed. Models constructed from multiple parents were found to be more accurate than models constructed from single parents only.

   Volume = {267},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {1268-1282.},
   Abstract = {Modeling by homology is the most accurate computational method for translating an amino acid sequence into a protein structure. Homology modeling can be divided into two sub-problems, placing the polypeptide backbone and adding side-chains. We present a method for rapidly predicting the conformations of protein side-chains, starting from main- chain coordinates alone. The method involves using fewer than ten rotamers per residue from a backbone-dependent rotamer library and a search to remove steric conflicts. The method is initially tested on 299 high resolution crystal structures by rebuilding side-chains onto the experimentally determined backbone structures. A total of 77% of chi1 and 66% of chi(1 + 2) dihedral angles are predicted within 40 degrees of their crystal structure values. We then tested the method on the entire database of known structures in the Protein Data Bank. The predictive accuracy of the algorithm was strongly correlated with the resolution of the structures. In an effort to simulate a realistic homology modeling problem, 9424 homology models were created using three different modeling strategies. For prediction purposes, pairs of structures were identified which shared between 30% and 90% sequence identity. One strategy results in 82% of chi1 and 72% chi(1 + 2) dihedral angles predicted within 40 degrees of the target crystal structure values, suggesting that movements of the backbone associated with this degree of sequence identity are not large enough to disrupt the predictive ability of our method for non-native backbones. These results compared favorably with existing methods over a comprehensive data set.},

   Abstract = {We have developed a method to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein molecule from such a set of distance constraints as can be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance studies. The currently popular methods for distance geometry based on the use of the metric matrix are applicable only to small systems. The method developed here is applicable to large molecules, such as proteins, with all atoms treated explicitly. This method works in the space of variable dihedral angles and determines a three-dimensional structure by minimization of a target function. We avoid difficulties hitherto inherent in this type of approach by two new devices: the use of variable target functions; and a method of rapid calculation of the gradient of the target functions. The method is applied to the determination of the structures of a small globular protein, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, from several artificial sets of distance constraints extracted from the X- ray crystal structure of this molecule. When a good set of constraints was available for both short- and long-range distances, the crystal structure was regenerated nearly exactly. When some ambiguities, such as those expected in experimental information, are allowed, the protein conformation can be determined up to a few local deformations. These ambiguities are mainly associated with the low resolving power of the short-range information.},

In addition to globular domains, many of the proteins have long, extended regions, either in the termini or in internal loops, which make extensive contact to the RNA component and are involved in stabilizing RNA tertiary structure. Many ribosomal proteins share similar alpha+beta sandwich folds, but we show that the topology of this domain varies considerably, as do the ways in which the proteins interact with RNA. Analysis of the protein-RNA interactions in the context of ribosomal assembly shows that the primary binders are globular proteins that bind at RNA multihelix junctions, whereas proteins with long extensions assemble later. We attempt to correlate the structure with a large body of biochemical and genetic data on the 30 S subunit.},

   Volume = {318},

   Pages = {59-70.},
   Abstract = {The correlation between sequence diversity and enzymatic function was studied in a library of Theta class glutathione transferases (GSTs) obtained by stochastic recombination of fragments of cDNA encoding human GST T1-1 and rat GST T2-2. In all, 94 randomly picked clones were characterized with respect to sequence, expression level, and catalytic activity in the conjugation reactions between glutathione and six alternative electrophilic substrates. Out of these six different compounds, dichloromethane is a selective substrate for human GST T1-1, whereas 1-menaphthyl sulfate and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene are substrates for rat GST T2-2. The other three substances serve as substrates for both enzymes. Through this broad characterization, we have identified enzyme variants that have acquired novel activity profiles that differ substantially from those of the original GSTs. In addition, the expression levels of many clones were improved in comparison to the parental enzyme. A library of mutants can thus display a distribution of properties from which highly divergent evolutionary pathways may emerge, resembling natural evolutionary processes. From the GST library, a clone was identified that, by the point mutation N49D in the rat GST T2-2 sequence, has a 1700% increased activity with 1-menaphthyl sulfate and a 60% decreased activity with 4- nitrophenethyl bromide. Through the N49D mutation, the ratio of these activities has thus been altered 40-fold. An extensive characterization of a population of stochastically mutated enzymes can accordingly be used to find variants with novel substrate-activity profiles and altered catalytic properties. Recursive recombination of selected sequences displaying optimized properties is a strategy for the engineering of proteins for medical and biochemical applications. Such sequential design is combinatorial protein chemistry based on remodeling of existing structural scaffolds and has similarities to evolutionary processes in nature.},

   Abstract = {The antigen-combining site of antibody molecules consists of six separate loops supported by a conserved beta-sheet framework; antibody specificity arises from length and sequence variation of these 'hypervariable' loops and can be manipulated by transferring sets of loops between different frameworks. Irregular loops are the most difficult parts of protein structure to understand and to model correctly. Here, we describe two computer experiments where all the hypervariable loops were deleted from X-ray structures of mouse immunoglobulins and reconstructed using the conformational search program CONGEN. A protocol was developed for reconstruction of the hypervariable loops in McPC 603 antibody. Calculated loop conformations were generated and a model of the combining site was built from selected low-energy conformations. We then modelled hypervariable loops in another antibody molecule, HyHEL-5. Both models agreed well with the known crystal structures. Our results hold out promise for the success of future modelling studies of complete antigen-combining sites from amino acid sequences.},

   Pages = {1847-1862.},
   Abstract = {High-temperature molecular dynamics as a method for conformational search was explored on the antigen combining site of McPC 603, a phosphorylcholine binding immunoglobulin. Simulations at temperatures of 500, 800, and 1500 K were run for 111.5, 101.7, and 76.3 ps, respectively. The effectiveness of the search was assessed using a variety of methods. For the shorter hypervariable loops, molecular dynamics explored an appreciable fraction of the conformational space as evidenced by a comparison to a simple theoretical model of the size of the conformational space. However, for the longer loops and the antigen combining site as a whole, the simulation times were too short for a complete search. The simulations at 500 and 800 K both generated conformations that minimized to energies 200 kcal/mole lower than the crystal structure. However, the 1500 K simulation produced higher energy structures, even after minimization; in addition, this highest temperature run had many cis-trans peptide isomerizations. This suggests that 1500 K is too high a temperature for unconstrained conformational sampling. Comparison of the results of high temperature molecular dynamics with a direct conformational search method, [R. E. Bruccoleri & M. Karplus (1987) Biopolymers 26, 137-168]. showed that the two methods did not overlap much in conformational space. Simple geometric measures of the conformational space indicated that the direct method covered more space than molecular dynamics at the lower temperature, but not at 1500 K. The results suggest that high- temperature molecular dynamics can aid in conformational searches.},

   Pages = {184-191.},
   Abstract = {The aim of LiveBench is to provide a continuous evaluation of structure prediction servers to inform developers and users about the current state-of-the-art structure prediction tools. LiveBench differs from other evaluation experiments because it is a large-scale and a fully automated procedure. Since LiveBench-1, which finished in April 2000, and related but independent CASP3 and CAFASP1 experiments, significant progress in the field has occurred. Some of the new developments have already been assessed at the recent CASP4 and CAFASP2 experiments (both independently of LiveBench), but others have not been observed yet because they entail developments carried out only recently. These include the availability of new servers (Pcons, FUGUE, and Coblath) and the enhancement of previously existing tools (mGenThreader, Sam-T, and 3D-PSSM), which illustrate the fast rate at which the field is advancing. Consequently, to keep in pace with the development, we present the results of the second large-scale evaluation of protein structure prediction servers. Of the 11 fold recognition servers evaluated, two servers appear to be most sensitive. One of these is 3D- PSSM, a server significantly improved after LiveBench-1. The other top performer is the new consensus server Pcons, which significantly outperformed other servers in the specificity of predictions. LiveBench- 2 shows that the top performing servers are able to accurately recognize a fold for about one third of the "difficult" targets, a clear improvement over LiveBench-1 results. Given that automated structure prediction is increasingly becoming a biologists companion, the guidelines drawn from the LiveBench experiments are likely to provide users with valuable and timely information for their prediction needs.},

By an application of the algorithm to the optimization of test functions and a comparison of the algorithm with other stochastic optimization methods, it is shown that the algorithm is a highly efficient optimization method. It was also applied in optimization of Lennard- Jones clusters and compared with other methods in this study.

The method is tested on different loops or peptide segments from immunoglobulin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and bovine trypsin. The predicted structure is obtained from the ensemble average of the coordinates of the Monte Carlo simulation at 300 K, which exhibits the lowest internal energy. The starting conformation of the loop prior to modeling is chosen to be completely extended, and a closing harmonic potential is applied to N, CA, C, and O atoms of the terminal residues. A rigid geometry potential of Robson and Platt (1986, J. Mol. Biol. 188, 259-281) with a united atom representation is used. This we demonstrate to yield a loop structure with good hydrogen bonding and torsion angles in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran map. The average accuracy of the modeling evaluated on the eight modeled loops is 1 A root mean square deviation (rmsd) for the backbone atoms and 2.3 A rmsd for all heavy atoms.},

Structural differences between generated structures are similar to those obtained from experiment and from MD simulation. Although detailed aspects of dynamical mechanisms are not covered and the extent of variations are only estimated in a relative sense, applications to an IgG-binding domain, an SH3 binding domain, HPr, calmodulin, and lysozyme are presented which illustrate the use of the method as a fast and simple way to predict structural variability in proteins. The method may be used to support the design of mutants, when structural fluctuations for a large number of mutants are to be screened. The results suggest that motional freedom in proteins is ruled largely by a set of simple geometric constraints.},

   Pages = {305-318.},
   Abstract = {We have developed a computational approach for the design and prediction of hydrophobic cores that includes explicit backbone flexibility. The program consists of a two-stage combination of a genetic algorithm and monte carlo sampling using a torsional model of the protein. Backbone structures are evaluated either by a canonical force-field or a constraining potential that emphasizes the preservation of local geometry. The utility of the method for protein design and engineering is explored by designing three novel hydrophobic core variants of the protein 434 cro. We use the new method to evaluate these and previously designed 434 cro variants, as well as a series of phage T4 lysozyme variants. In order to properly evaluate the influence of backbone flexibility, we have also analyzed the effects of varying amounts of side-chain flexibility on the performance of fixed backbone methods. Comparison of results using a fixed versus flexible backbone reveals that, surprisingly, the two methods are almost equivalent in their abilities to predict relative experimental stabilities, but only when full side-chain flexibility is allowed. The prediction of core side-chain structure can vary dramatically between methods. In some, but not all, cases the flexible backbone method is a better predictor of structure. The development of a flexible backbone approach to core design is particularly important for attempts at de novo protein design, where there is no prior knowledge of a precise backbone structure.},

   Abstract = {The prokaryotic enhancer-binding protein XylR is the central regulator of the toluene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas species. Copious genetic and biochemical data indicate that the N-terminal domain of the protein (domain A) interacts directly with m-xylene, which renders the protein competent as a transcriptional activator. Single-site and shuffling mutants of XylR or homologues have been reported to change or expand their effector profiles. Here, we follow a fold recognition approach to generate three-dimensional models of the domain A of XylR and DmpR with the purpose of deciphering the molecular activity of this protein family. The model is based on the crystallographic data of the rat catechol O-methyltransferase, a typical alpha/beta fold, consisting of eight alpha-helices and seven beta-strands. The fold identification is supported by physico-chemical properties of conserved amino acids, distribution of residues characteristic of the sequence families and confrontation with experimental data. The model not only provides a rationale for understanding published experimental data, but also suggests the molecular mechanism of the activation step and is a potentially useful conceptual tool for designing regulators with predefined inducer specificities.},

   Pages = {98-107.},
   Abstract = {The widening gap between known protein sequences and their functions has led to the practice of assigning a potential function to a protein on the basis of sequence similarity to proteins whose function has been experimentally investigated. We present here a critical view of the theoretical and practical bases for this approach. The results obtained by analyzing a significant number of true sequence similarities, derived directly from structural alignments, point to the complexity of function prediction. Different aspects of protein function, including (i) enzymatic function classification, (ii) functional annotations in the form of key words, (iii) classes of cellular function, and (iv) conservation of binding sites can only be reliably transferred between similar sequences to a modest degree. The reason for this difficulty is a combination of the unavoidable database inaccuracies and the plasticity of protein function. In addition, analysis of the relationship between sequence and functional descriptions defines an empirical limit for pairwise-based functional annotations, namely, the three first digits of the six numbers used as descriptors of protein folds in the FSSP database can be predicted at an average level as low as 7.5% sequence identity, two of the four EC digits at 15% identity, half of the SWISS-PROT key words related to protein function would require 20% identity, and the prediction of half of the residues in the binding site can be made at the 30% sequence identity level.},

   Pages = {543-574.},
   Abstract = {A backbone-dependent rotamer library for amino acid side-chains is developed and used for constructing protein side-chain conformations from the main-chain co-ordinates. The rotamer library is obtained from 132 protein chains in the Brookhaven Protein Database. A grid of 20 degrees by 20 degrees blocks for the main-chain angles phi, psi is used in the rotamer library. Significant correlations are found between side- chain dihedral angle probabilities and backbone phi, psi values. These probabilities are used to place the side-chains on the known backbone in test applications for six proteins for which high-resolution crystal structures are available. A minimization scheme is used to reorient side-chains that conflict with the backbone or other side-chains after the initial placement. The initial placement yields 59% of both chi 1 and chi 2 values in the correct position (to within 40 degrees) for thermolysin to 81% for crambin. After refinement the values range from 61% (lysozyme) to 89% (crambin). It is evident from the results that a single protein does not adequately test a prediction scheme. The computation time required by the method scales linearly with the number of side-chains. An initial prediction from the library takes only a few seconds of computer time, while the iterative refinement takes on the order of hours. The method is automated and can easily be applied to aid experimental side-chain determinations and homology modeling. The high degree of correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations may introduce a simplification in the protein folding process by reducing the available conformational space.},

   Abstract = {One of the most central methods in bioinformatics is the alignment of two protein or DNA sequences. However, so far large-scale benchmarks examining the quality of these alignments are scarce. On the other hand, recently several large-scale studies of the capacity of different methods to identify related sequences has led to new insights about the performance of fold recognition methods. To increase our understanding about fold recognition methods, we present a large-scale benchmark of alignment quality. We compare alignments from several different alignment methods, including sequence alignments, hidden Markov models, PSI-BLAST, CLUSTALW, and threading methods. For most methods, the alignment quality increases significantly at about 20% sequence identity. The difference in alignment quality between different methods is quite small, and the main difference can be seen at the exact positioning of the sharp rise in alignment quality, that is, around 15- 20% sequence identity. The alignments are improved by using structural information. In general, the best alignments are obtained by methods that use predicted secondary structure information and sequence profiles obtained from PSI-BLAST. One interesting observation is that for different pairs many different methods create the best alignments. This finding implies that if a method that could select the best alignment method for each pair existed, a significant improvement of the alignment quality could be gained.},

   Abstract = {We tested the dihedral probability grid Monte Carlo (DPG-MC) methodology to determine optimal conformations of polypeptides by applying it to predict the low energy ensemble for two peptides whose solution NMR structures are known: integrin receptor peptide (YGRGDSP, Type II beta-turn) and S3 alpha-helical peptide (YMSEDEL KAAEAAFKRHGPT). DPG-MC involves importance sampling, local random stepping in the vicinity of a current local minima, and Metropolis sampling criteria for acceptance or rejection of new structures. Internal coordinate values are based on side-chain-specific dihedral angle probability distributions (from analysis of high-resolution protein crystal structures). Important features of DPG-MC are: (1) Each DPG-MC step selects the torsion angles (phi, psi, chi) from a discrete grid that are then applied directly to the structure. The torsion angle increments can be taken as S = 60, 30, 15, 10, or 5 degrees, depending on the application. (2) DPG-MC utilizes a temperature-dependent probability function (P) in conjunction with Metropolis sampling to accept or reject new structures. For each peptide, we found close agreement with the known structure for the low energy conformational ensemble located with DPG-MC. This suggests that DPG-MC will be useful for predicting conformations of other polypeptides.},

   Abstract = {Two principal methods of determining the conformation of short pieces of polypeptide backbone in proteins have been developed: using a database of known structures and systematically generating all conformations. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of these two techniques. The completeness of the database for segments of different lengths is examined and it is found to contain most conformations for segments seven residues long, but to deteriorate rapidly for longer regions. When the database segment is to be incorporated into the rest of a structure, at least seven residues are required to build four new residues, because of the need to position the segment relative to the rest of the structure. It is found that such positioning using flanking residues results in large errors in the inserted region. We conclude that the database method is currently not effective for comparative modeling, even for short segments. The systematic search procedure is found to generate almost all structures of short segments found in proteins. In contrast to the database method, low root mean square error structures are obtained for a set of trial segments embedded in the rest of a protein structure. Thus, it should be considered the method of choice.},

   Pages = {342-362.},
   Abstract = {We describe a method for predicting the conformations of loops in proteins and its application to four of the complementarity determining regions [CDRs] in the crystallographically determined structure of MCPC603. The method is based on the generation of a large number of randomly generated conformations for the backbone of the loop being studied, followed by either minimization or molecular dynamics followed by minimization starting from these random structures. The details of the algorithm for the generation of the loops are presented in the first paper in this series (Shenkin et al. [submitted]). The results of minimization and molecular dynamics applied to these loops is presented here. For the two shortest CDRs studied (H1 and L2, which are five and seven amino acids long), minimizations and dynamics simulations which ignore interactions of the loop amino acids beyond the carbon beta replicate the conformation of the crystal structure closely. This suggests that these loops fold independently of sequence variation. For the third CDR (L3, which is nine amino acids), those portions of the CDR near its base which are hydrogen bonded to framework are well replicated by our procedures, but the top of the loop shows significant conformational variability. This variability persists when side chain interactions for the MCPC603 sequence are included. For a fourth CDR (H3, which is 11 amino acids long), new low-energy backbone conformations are found; however, only those which are close to the crystal are compatible with the sequence when side chain interactions are taken into account. Results from minimization and dynamics on single CDRs with all other CDRs removed are presented. These allow us to explore the extent to which individual CDR conformations are determined by interactions with framework only.},

   Abstract = {Recent assessments of structure prediction have demonstrated that (i) although fold recognition methods can often identify remote similarities when standard sequence search methods fail, the score of the top-ranking fold is not always significant enough to allow a confident prediction; (ii) the use of structural information such as secondary structure increases recognition accuracy; (iii) modern sequence-based methods incorporating evolutionary information from neighboring sequences can often identify very remote similarities; (iv) there is no one single method that is superior to other methods when evaluated over a wide range of targets, and (v) extensive human-expert intervention is usually required for the most difficult prediction targets. Here, I describe a new, hybrid fold recognition method that incorporates structural and evolutionary information into a single fully automated method. This work is a first attempt towards the automation of some of the processes that are often applied by human predictors. The method is tested with two cases that are often applied by human predictors. The method is tested with two fold-recognition benchmarks demonstrating a superior performance. The higher sensitivity and selectivity enable the applicability of this method at genomic scales.},

   Volume = {9},
   Number = {9},
   Pages = {1753-1773.},
   Abstract = {Comparative protein structure prediction is limited mostly by the errors in alignment and loop modeling. We describe here a new automated modeling technique that significantly improves the accuracy of loop predictions in protein structures. The positions of all nonhydrogen atoms of the loop are optimized in a fixed environment with respect to a pseudo energy function. The energy is a sum of many spatial restraints that include the bond length, bond angle, and improper dihedral angle terms from the CHARMM-22 force field, statistical preferences for the main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles, and statistical preferences for nonbonded atomic contacts that depend on the two atom types, their distance through space, and separation in sequence. The energy function is optimized with the method of conjugate gradients combined with molecular dynamics and simulated annealing. Typically, the predicted loop conformation corresponds to the lowest energy conformation among 500 independent optimizations. Predictions were made for 40 loops of known structure at each length from 1 to 14 residues. The accuracy of loop predictions is evaluated as a function of thoroughness of conformational sampling, loop length, and structural properties of native loops. When accuracy is measured by local superposition of the model on the native loop, 100, 90, and 30% of 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loop predictions, respectively, had <2 A RMSD error for the mainchain N, C(alpha), C, and O atoms; the average accuracies were 0.59 +/- 0.05, 1.16 +/- 0.10, and 2.61 +/- 0.16 A, respectively. To simulate real comparative modeling problems, the method was also evaluated by predicting loops of known structure in only approximately correct environments with errors typical of comparative modeling without misalignment. When the RMSD distortion of the main-chain stem atoms is 2.5 A, the average loop prediction error increased by 180, 25, and 3% for 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loops, respectively. The accuracy of the lowest energy prediction for a given loop can be estimated from the structural variability among a number of low energy predictions. The relative value of the present method is gauged by (1) comparing it with one of the most successful previously described methods, and (2) describing its accuracy in recent blind predictions of protein structure. Finally, it is shown that the average accuracy of prediction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the energy function rather than by the extent of conformational sampling.},

   Abstract = {To investigate the activation mechanism of the enhancer-binding protein XylR encoded by the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2, a combinatorial library was generated composed of shuffled N-terminal A domains of the homologous regulators DmpR, XylR and TbuT, reassembled within the XylR structure. When the library was screened in vivo for responsiveness to non-effectors bulkier than one aromatic ring (such as biphenyl) or bearing an entirely different distribution of electronegative groups (e.g. nitrotoluenes), protein variants were found that displayed an expanded inducer range including the new effectors. Although the phenotypes endowed with the corresponding changes were largely similar, the modifications involved different sites within the A domain. The positions of the mutations within a structural model of the A domain suggest that expansion of the inducer profile can be brought about not only by changes in the effector pocket of the protein but also by unlocking steps of the signal transmission mechanism that follows effector binding. These results provide a rationale for evolving in vitro regulators a la carte that are responsive to predetermined, natural or xenobiotic chemical species.},

   Pages = {445-456.},
   Abstract = {We apply a simple method for aligning protein sequences on the basis of a 3D structure, on a large scale, to the proteins in the scop classification of fold families. This allows us to assess, understand, and improve our automatic method against an objective, manually derived standard, a type of comprehensive evaluation that has not yet been possible for other structural alignment algorithms. Our basic approach directly matches the backbones of two structures, using repeated cycles of dynamic programming and least-squares fitting to determine an alignment minimizing coordinate difference. Because of simplicity, our method can be readily modified to take into account additional features of protein structure such as the orientation of side chains or the location-dependent cost of opening a gap. Our basic method, augmented by such modifications, can find reasonable alignments for all but 1.5% of the known structural similarities in scop, i.e., all but 32 of the 2,107 superfamily pairs. We discuss the specific protein structural features that make these 32 pairs so difficult to align and show how our procedure effectively partitions the relationships in scop into different categories, depending on what aspects of protein structure are involved (e.g., depending on whether or not consideration of side- chain orientation is necessary for proper alignment). We also show how our pairwise alignment procedure can be extended to generate a multiple alignment for a group of related structures. We have compared these alignments in detail with corresponding manual ones culled from the literature. We find good agreement (to within 95% for the core regions), and detailed comparison highlights how particular protein structural features (such as certain strands) are problematical to align, giving somewhat ambiguous results. With these improvements and systematic tests, our procedure should be useful for the development of scop and the future classification of protein folds.},

   Abstract = {Profile analysis is a method for detecting distantly related proteins by sequence comparison. The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences.},

   Pages = {425-435.},
   Abstract = {With the use of a recently developed method, twenty-four proteins for which two or more X-ray conformers are known have been analyzed to reveal structural principles that govern domain motions in proteins. In all 24 cases, the domain motion is a rotation about a physical axis created through local interactions both covalent and noncovalent. In many cases, two or more mechanical hinges separated in space create a stable hinge axis for precise control of the domain closure. The terminal regions of alpha-helices and beta-sheets have been found to act as mechanical hinges in a significant number of cases. In some cases, the two terminal regions of neighboring strands of a single beta- sheet can create a hinge axis, as can the two termini of a single alpha- helix. These two structures have been termed the "double-hinged beta- sheet" and "double-hinged alpha-helix," respectively. A flexible loop that attaches one domain to another and through which the effective hinge axis passes is another construct that is used to create a hinge. Noncovalent interactions between segments remote along the polypeptide chain can also form hinges. In addition alpha-helices that preserve their hydrogen bonding structure when bent have been found to behave as mechanical hinges. It is suggested that these alpha-helices act as a store of elastic energy that drives the closing of domains for rapid capture of the substrate. If the repertoire of possible interdomain structures is as limited as this study suggests, the dynamic behavior of proteins could soon be predicted using bioinformatics techniques.

   Abstract = {Several choices of amino acid substitution matrices are currently available for searching and alignment applications. These choices were evaluated using the BLAST searching program, which is extremely sensitive to differences among matrices, and the Prosite catalog, which lists members of hundreds of protein families. Matrices derived directly from either sequence-based or structure-based alignments of distantly related proteins performed much better overall than extrapolated matrices based on the Dayhoff evolutionary model. Similar results were obtained with the FASTA searching program. Improved performance appears to be general rather than family-specific, reflecting improved accuracy in scoring alignments. An implementation of a multiple matrix strategy was also tested. While no combination of three matrices performed as well as the single best matrix, BLOSUM 62, good results were obtained using a combination of sequence-based and structure-based matrices. This hybrid set of matrices is likely to be useful in certain situations. Our results illustrate the importance of matrix selection and the value of a comprehensive approach to evaluation of protein comparison tools.},

   Pages = {471-479.},
   Abstract = {MOTIVATION: As databanks grow, sequence classification and prediction of function by searching protein family databases becomes increasingly valuable. The original Blocks Database, which contains ungapped multiple alignments for families documented in Prosite, can be searched to classify new sequences. However, Prosite is incomplete, and families from other databases are now available to expand coverage of the Blocks Database. RESULTS: To take advantage of protein family information present in several existing compilations, we have used five databases to construct Blocks+, a unified database that is built on the PROTOMAT/BLOSUM scoring model and that can be searched using a single algorithm for consistent sequence classification. The LAMA blocks- versus-blocks searching program identifies overlapping protein families, making possible a non-redundant hierarchical compilation. Blocks+ consists of all blocks derived from PROSITE, blocks from Prints not present in PROSITE, blocks from Pfam-A not present in PROSITE or Prints, and so on for ProDom and Domo, for a total of 1995 protein families represented by 8909 blocks, doubling the coverage of the original Blocks Database. A challenge for any procedure aimed at non- redundancy is to retain related but distinct families while discarding those that are duplicates. We illustrate how using multiple compilations can minimize this potential problem by examining the SNF2 family of ATPases, which is detectably similar to distinct families of helicases and ATPases.

   Abstract = {The integrins are cell membrane receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits which orchestrate adhesive events in all tissues of the body (Hynes, R.O., 1992. Integrins: versatility, modulation, and signalling in cell adhesion. Cell 69, 11-25; and Hynes, R.O., 1999. Cell adhesion: old and new questions. Trends Cell Biol. 9, M33-37). At present 18 alpha subunits and 8 beta subunits have been identified which are loosely organised into families. There are three inherited autosomal recessive diseases in man which involve germline mutations in genes coding for integrins. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) is the result of mutations in the beta2 subunit of the CD11/CD18 integrins, LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95 and alphadbeta2. The bleeding disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia is caused by mutations in either the alpha or beta subunit of the platelet integrin, alphaIIbbeta3. Thirdly, it is now recognised than one of the variants of the usually lethal skin blistering disorder, epidermolysis bullosa (JEB-PA), is caused by mutation in either the alpha or beta subunit of the epithelial hemidesmosome integrin, alpha6beta4. Many of the mutations cause defective alphabeta heterodimer formation. The majority of the beta subunit mutations are in the conserved N-terminal region known as the betaI domain. It is suggested that this region participates in alphabeta heterodimer formation.},

   Abstract = {The problem of constructing all-atom model co-ordinates of a protein from an outline of the polypeptide chain is encountered in protein structure determination by crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in model building by homology and in protein design. Here, we present an automatic procedure for generating full protein co-ordinates (backbone and, optionally, side-chains) given the C alpha trace and amino acid sequence. To construct backbones, a protein structure database is first scanned for fragments that locally fit the chain trace according to distance criteria. A best path algorithm then sifts through these segments and selects an optimal path with minimal mismatch at fragment joints. In blind tests, using fully known protein structures, backbones (C alpha, C, N, O) can be reconstructed with a reliability of 0.4 to 0.6 A root-mean-square position deviation and not more than 0 to 5% peptide flips. This accuracy is sufficient to identify possible errors in protein co- ordinate sets. To construct full co-ordinates, side-chains are added from a library of frequently occurring rotamers using a simple and fast Monte Carlo procedure with simulated annealing. In tests on X-ray structures determined at better than 2.5 A resolution, the positions of side-chain atoms in the protein core (less than 20% relative accessibility) have an accuracy of 1.6 A (r.m.s. deviation) and 70% of chi 1 angles are within 30 degrees of the X-ray structure.

   Abstract = {Important properties of globular proteins, such as the stability of the folded state, depend sensitively on interactions with solvent molecules. An excluded volume approximation to protein-solvent interaction, the solvent contact model, was used to derive atomic solvation preference parameters from a database of known protein structures. The ability of solvation preference to discriminate between correct and incorrect three-dimensional structures for a given sequence, or to identify the correct sequence placement in a given structure, was tested. Backbone co-ordinates were taken from experimentally known structures or hypothetical models and side-chain conformations (in rotamer space) were optimized by an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm using simulated annealing and simple potential functions. Discrimination by solvation preference was very clear between deliberately misfolded and correct globular models as well as between native-like and non-native-like topologies of combinatorially generated myoglobin models. Due to its statistical nature, the evaluation works best on entire protein models, while the identification of incorrect parts of models is more difficult. In one case locally incorrect chain tracing in a crystal structure was identified. The method is computationally fast compared to methods based on surface area calculations and is recommended for use as a diagnostic tool in model building based on sequence similarity, in folding simulations and in protein design.},

   Abstract = {An unknown protein structure can be predicted with fair accuracy once an evolutionary connection at the sequence level has been made to a protein of known 3-D structure. In model building by homology, one typically starts with a backbone framework, rebuilds new loop regions, and replaces nonconserved side chains. Here, we use an extremely efficient Monte Carlo algorithm in rotamer space with simulated annealing and simple potential energy functions to optimize the packing of side chains on given backbone models. Optimized models are generated within minutes on a workstation, with reasonable accuracy (average of 81% side chain chi 1 dihedral angles correct in the cores of proteins determined at better than 2.5 A resolution). As expected, the quality of the models decreases with decreasing accuracy of backbone coordinates. If the back-bone was taken from a homologous rather than the same protein, about 70% side chain chi 1 angles were modeled correctly in the core in a case of strong homology and about 60% in a case of medium homology. The algorithm can be used in automated, fast, and reproducible model building by homology.},

   Pages = {123-138.},
   Abstract = {With a rapidly growing pool of known tertiary structures, the importance of protein structure comparison parallels that of sequence alignment. We have developed a novel algorithm (DALI) for optimal pairwise alignment of protein structures. The three-dimensional co- ordinates of each protein are used to calculate residue-residue (C alpha-C alpha) distance matrices. The distance matrices are first decomposed into elementary contact patterns, e.g. hexapeptide- hexapeptide submatrices. Then, similar contact patterns in the two matrices are paired and combined into larger consistent sets of pairs. A Monte Carlo procedure is used to optimize a similarity score defined in terms of equivalent intramolecular distances. Several alignments are optimized in parallel, leading to simultaneous detection of the best, second-best and so on solutions. The method allows sequence gaps of any length, reversal of chain direction and free topological connectivity of aligned segments. Sequential connectivity can be imposed as an option. The method is fully automatic and identifies structural resemblances and common structural cores accurately and sensitively, even in the presence of geometrical distortions. An all-against-all alignment of over 200 representative protein structures results in an objective classification of known three-dimensional folds in agreement with visual classifications. Unexpected topological similarities of biological interest have been detected, e.g. between the bacterial toxin colicin A and globins, and between the eukaryotic POU-specific DNA-binding domain and the bacterial lambda repressor.},

Both of these approaches indicate that the crystal environment plays an important role in determining the conformations of polar side-chains on the surfaces of proteins. Inclusion of the crystal environment permits a more sensitive measurement of the achievable accuracy of side-chain prediction programs, when validating against structures obtained by X-ray crystallography. Our side-chain prediction program uses an all-atom force field and a Generalized Born model of solvation and is thus capable of modeling simple packing effects (i.e. van der Waals interactions), electrostatic effects, and desolvation, which are all important mechanisms by which the crystal environment impacts observed side-chain conformations. Our results are also relevant to the understanding of changes in side-chain conformation that may result from ligand docking and protein-protein association, insofar as the results reveal how side-chain conformations change in response to their local environment.},

   Abstract = {A free energy function, combining molecular mechanics energy with empirical solvation and entropic terms, is used for ranking near-native conformations that occur in the conformational search steps of homology modeling, i.e., side-chain search and loop closure calculations. Correlations between the free energy and RMS deviation from the X-ray structure are established. It is shown that generally both molecular mechanics and solvation/entropic terms should be included in the potential. The identification of near-native backbone conformations is accomplished primarily by the molecular mechanics term that becomes the dominant contribution to the free energy if the backbone is even slightly strained, as frequently occurs in loop closure calculations. Both terms become equally important if a sufficiently accurate backbone conformation is found. Finally, the selection of the best side-chain positions for a fixed backbone is almost completely governed by the solvation term. The discriminatory power of the combined potential is demonstrated by evaluating the free energies of protein models submitted to the first meeting on Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP1), and comparing them to the free energies of the native conformations.},

   Abstract = {Understanding the relations between the conformation of the side-chains and the backbone geometry is crucial for structure prediction as well as for homology modelling. To attempt to unravel these rules, we have developed a method which allows us to predict the position of the side- chains from the co-ordinates of the main-chain atoms. This method is based on a rotamer library and refines iteratively a conformational matrix of the side-chains of a protein, CM, such that its current element at each cycle CM (ij) gives the probability that side-chain i of the protein adopts the conformation of its possible rotamer j. Each residue feels the average of all possible environments, weighted by their respective probabilities. The method converges in only a few cycles, thereby deserving the name of self consistent mean field method. Using the rotamer with the highest probability in the optimized conformational matrix to define the conformation of the side-chain leads to the result that on average 72% of chi 1, 75% of chi 2 and 62% of chi 1 + 2 are correctly predicted for a set of 30 proteins. Tests with six pairs of homologous proteins have shown that the method is quite successful even when the protein backbone deviates from the correct conformation. The second application of the optimized conformational matrix was to provide estimates of the conformational entropy of the side-chains in the folded state of the protein. The relevance of this entropy is discussed.},

   Abstract = {We have developed a fully automated protein design strategy that works on the entire sequence of the protein and uses a full atom representation. At each step of the procedure, an all-atom model of the protein is built using the template protein structure and the current designed sequence. The energy of the model is used to drive a Monte Carlo optimization in sequence space: random moves are either accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis criterion. We rely on the physical forces that stabilize native protein structures to choose the optimum sequence. Our energy function includes van der Waals interactions, electrostatics and an environment free energy. Successful protein design should be specific and generate a sequence compatible with the template fold and incompatible with competing folds. We impose specificity by maintaining the amino acid composition constant, based on the random energy model. The specificity of the optimized sequence is tested by fold recognition techniques. Successful sequence designs for the B1 domain of protein G, for the lambda repressor and for sperm whale myoglobin are presented. We show that each additional term of the energy function improves the performance of our design procedure: the van der Waals term ensures correct packing, the electrostatics term increases the specificity for the correct native fold, and the environment solvation term ensures a correct pattern of buried hydrophobic and exposed hydrophilic residues. For the globin family, we show that we can design a protein sequence that is stable in the myoglobin fold, yet incompatible with the very similar hemoglobin fold.},

   Abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF- hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L- type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both.},

   Volume = {259},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {855-872.},
   Abstract = {A bank of loops from three to eight amino acid residues long has been constituted. On the basis of statistical analysis of occurrences of conformations and residue, loops could be divided into two parts: the side residues directly bonded to the secondary structure flanking element, and the inner part. The conformations of the side residues are correlated to the nature of their neighboring flanks, while the inner residues adopt conformations uncorrelated from one residue to the next; thus they are unrelated to the flanks. Two zones in the Ramachandran plot are important: alpha L and beta P. In particular, the high occurrence of alpha L, mainly occupied by glycine residues, is necessary to induce flexibility and thus allow loops to comply with the geometrical constraints of the flanks. An algorithm of clustering has been used to aggregate loops of the same length within families of similar 3D structures. At each position in each cluster, sequence and conformational signatures have been deduced if the occurrence of a residue (or a conformation) is higher than an equiprobable distribution over all clusters. The result is that some positions favor particular amino acids and conformations, which are typical of a cluster although not unique. This is an indication of a relation between structure and sequence in loops. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies the various clusters. It relies on two terms: the mean distance between the first and last C alpha in one cluster and, perpendicular to this line, the distance to the center of gravity of the cluster. It is noteworthy that the differently populated clusters represented in such 2D plots can be separated. Thus, although the conformations of loops in globular proteins could cover a continuum, it has been possible to cluster them into a limited number of well populated families and superfamilies. This basic feature of protein architecture could be further exploited to better predict their geometry.},

   Abstract = {Motivation: Homology or comparative modeling is currently the most accurate method to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins. It generally consists in four steps: (1) databanks searching to identify the structural homolog, (2) target-template alignment, (3) model building and optimization, and (4) model evaluation. The target- template alignment step is generally accepted as the most critical step in homology modeling. Results: We present here ESyPred3D, a new automated homology modeling program. The method gets benefit of the increased alignment performances of a new alignment strategy. Alignments are obtained by combining, weighting and screening the results of several multiple alignment programs. The final three- dimensional structure is build using the modeling package MODELLER. ESyPred3D was tested on 13 targets in the CASP4 experiment (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Proteins Structural Prediction). Our alignment strategy obtains better results compared to PSI-BLAST alignments and ESyPred3D alignments are among the most accurate compared to those of participants having used the same template.

   Abstract = {Recently it has been shown that the dead-end elimination theorem is a powerful tool in the search for the global minimum energy conformation (GMEC) of a large collection of protein side chains given known backbone coordinates and a library of allowed side chain conformational states, also known as rotamers. A side chain placement algorithm based on this theorem iteratively applies this theorem to single as well as to pairs of rotamers leading to the identification of rotamers, single or pairs, that are incompatible with the GMEC and that can thus be qualified as 'dead-ending'. Here we formulate a theorem which proves that contrary to intuition dead-end rotamer pairs cannot simply be discarded from consideration in the iterative process leading to the further elimination of dead-end rotamers. We refer to this theorem as the fuzzy-end elimination theorem. We also describe how the obtained dead-end rotamer pairs can contribute to the search for the GMEC in the protein side chain placement problem. Hence the present work forms a theoretical basis for the correct implementation of a side chain placement algorithm based on the dead-end elimination theorem. In addition, possible future perspectives are presented.},

   Pages = {373-388.},
   Abstract = {We have developed a rapid and completely automatic method for prediction of protein side-chain conformation, applying the simulated annealing algorithm to optimization of side-chain packing (van der Waals) interactions. The method directly attacks the combinatorial problem of simultaneously predicting many residues' conformation, solving in 8 to 12 hours problems for which the systematic search would require over 10(300) central processing unit years. Over a test set of nine proteins ranging in size from 46 to 323 residues, the program's predictions for side-chain atoms had a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.77 A overall versus the native structures. More importantly, the predictions for core residues were especially accurate, with an r.m.s. value of 1.25 A overall: 80 to 90% of the large hydrophobic side-chains dominating the internal core were correctly predicted, versus 30 to 40% for most current methods. The predictions' main errors were in surface residues poorly constrained by packing and small residues with greater steric freedom and hydrogen bonding interactions, which were not included in the program's potential function. van der Waals interactions appear to be the supreme determinant of the arrangement of side-chains in the core, enforcing a unique allowed packing that in every case so far examined matches the native structure.},

Ideally, the final stages should be able to identify the native state, show a good correlation with native similarity in order to add value to the selection process, and refine the structures even further. In this work, we explore the possibility of using state-of-the-art explicit solvent molecular dynamics and implicit solvent free energy calculations to accomplish all three of those objectives on 12 small, single-domain proteins, four each of alpha, beta and mixed topologies. We find that this approach is very successful in ranking the native and also enhances the structure selection of predictions generated from the Rosetta method.},

   Abstract = {We have developed an automatic approach for homology modeling using restrained molecular dynamics and simulated annealing procedures, together with conformational search algorithms available in the molecular mechanics program CONGEN (Bruccoleri RE, Karplus M, 1987, Biopolymers 26:137-168). The accuracy of the method is validated by "predicting" structures of two homeodomain proteins with known three- dimensional structures, and then applied to predict the three- dimensional structure of the homeodomain of the murine Msx-1 transcription factor. Regions of the unknown protein structure that are highly homologous to the known template structure are constrained by "homology distance constraints," whereas the conformations of nonhomologous regions of the unknown protein are defined only by the potential energy function. A full energy function (excluding explicit solvent) is employed to ensure that the calculated structures have good conformational energies and are physically reasonable. As in NMR structure determinations, information on the consistency of the structure prediction is obtained by superposition of the resulting family of protein structures. In this paper, our homology modeling algorithm is described and compared with related homology modeling methods using spatial constraints derived from the structures of homologous proteins. The software is then used to predict the DNA-bound structures of three homeodomain proteins from the X-ray crystal structure of the engrailed homeodomain protein (Kissinger CR et al., 1990, Cell 63:579-590). The resulting backbone and side-chain conformations of the modeled yeast Mat alpha 2 and D. melanogaster Antennapedia homeodomains are excellent matches to the corresponding published X-ray crystal (Wolberger C et al., 1991, Cell 67:517-528) and NMR (Billeter M et al., 1993, J.Mol.Biol. 234:1084-1097) structures, respectively. Examination of these structures of Msx-1 reveals a network of highly conserved surface salt bridges that are proposed to play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions of homeodomains in transcription complexes.},

   Volume = {11},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {322-331.},
   Abstract = {Modeling side-chain conformations on a fixed protein backbone has a wide application in structure prediction and molecular design. Each effort in this field requires decisions about a rotamer set, scoring function, and search strategy. We have developed a new and simple scoring function, which operates on side-chain rotamers and consists of the following energy terms: contact surface, volume overlap, backbone dependency, electrostatic interactions, and desolvation energy. The weights of these energy terms were optimized to achieve the minimal average root mean square (rms) deviation between the lowest energy rotamer and real side-chain conformation on a training set of high- resolution protein structures. In the course of optimization, for every residue, its side chain was replaced by varying rotamers, whereas conformations for all other residues were kept as they appeared in the crystal structure. We obtained prediction accuracy of 90.4% for chi(1), 78.3% for chi(1 + 2), and 1.18 A overall rms deviation. Furthermore, the derived scoring function combined with a Monte Carlo search algorithm was used to place all side chains onto a protein backbone simultaneously. The average prediction accuracy was 87.9% for chi(1), 73.2% for chi(1 + 2), and 1.34 A rms deviation for 30 protein structures. Our approach was compared with available side-chain construction methods and showed improvement over the best among them: 4.4% for chi(1), 4.7% for chi(1 + 2), and 0.21 A for rms deviation. We hypothesize that the scoring function instead of the search strategy is the main obstacle in side-chain modeling. Additionally, we show that a more detailed rotamer library is expected to increase chi(1 + 2) prediction accuracy but may have little effect on chi(1) prediction accuracy.},

   Abstract = {Over the last decade, structural biologists have unravelled many proteins that appear natively disordered. Common assumptions are that many of these proteins adopt structure through binding and that the structural flexibility enables them to adopt different functions. Here, we investigated regions of more than 70 sequence-consecutive residues that have no regular secondary structure (NORS). Analysing 31 entirely sequenced organisms, we predicted five times as many proteins with NORS regions (loopy proteins) in eukaryotes (20%) than in prokaryotes and archaeas (4%). Thousands of these NORS regions were over 150 residues long. The amino acid composition of NORS regions differed from that of loops in PDB. Although NORS proteins had significantly more residues in low-complexity regions than other proteins, simple cut-off thresholds for sequence bias missed most NORS regions. On average, NORS regions were evolutionarily at least as conserved as their flanking regions. Furthermore, yeast proteins with NORS regions had more protein-protein interaction partners than other proteins. Regulatory and transcription- related functions were over-represented in loopy proteins, biosynthesis and energy metabolism were under-represented. Overall, our analysis confirmed that proteins with non-regular structures appear to play important functional roles, and they may adopt as yet unknown types of protein structures.},

   Abstract = {We predict interatomic Calpha distances by two independent data driven methods.

These two methods are used to predict whether distances in independent test sets were above or below given thresholds. We investigate which distance thresholds produce the most information-rich constraints and, in turn, the optimal performance of the two methods. The predictions are based on a data set derived using a new threshold which defines when sequence similarity implies structural similarity. We show that distances in proteins are predicted more accurately by neural networks than by probability density functions. We show that the accuracy of the predictions can be further increased by using sequence profiles. A threading method based on the predicted distances is presented.

   Journal = {Protein Sci.},
   Volume = {10},
   Number = {11},
   Pages = {2354-2362.},
   Abstract = {During recent years many protein fold recognition methods have been developed, based on different algorithms and using various kinds of information. To examine the performance of these methods several evaluation experiments have been conducted. These include blind tests in CASP/CAFASP, large scale benchmarks, and long-term, continuous assessment with newly solved protein structures. These studies confirm the expectation that for different targets different methods produce the best predictions, and the final prediction accuracy could be improved if the available methods were combined in a perfect manner. In this article a neural-network-based consensus predictor, Pcons, is presented that attempts this task. Pcons attempts to select the best model out of those produced by six prediction servers, each using different methods. Pcons translates the confidence scores reported by each server into uniformly scaled values corresponding to the expected accuracy of each model. The translated scores as well as the similarity between models produced by different servers is used in the final selection. According to the analysis based on two unrelated sets of newly solved proteins, Pcons outperforms any single server by generating approximately 8%-10% more correct predictions. Furthermore, the specificity of Pcons is significantly higher than for any individual server. From analyzing different input data to Pcons it can be shown that the improvement is mainly attributable to measurement of the similarity between the different models. Pcons is freely accessible for the academic community through the protein structure-prediction metaserver at http://bioinfo.pl/meta/.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, a method of simulating the docking of small flexible ligands to flexible receptors in water is reported. The method is based on molecular dynamics simulations and is an extension of an algorithm previously reported by Di Nola et al. (Di Nola et al., Proteins 1994;19:174-182). The method allows a fast exploration of the receptor surface, using a high temperature of the center of mass translational motion, while the ligand internal motions, the solvent, and the receptor are simulated at room temperature. In addition, the method allows a fast center of mass motion of the ligand, even in solution. The dampening effect of the solvent can be overcome by applying different weights to the interactions between system subsets (solvent, receptor, and ligand). Specific ligand-receptor distances have been used to compare the results of the simulations with the crystal structure. The method is applied, as a test system, to the docking of the phosphocholine to the immunoglobulin McPC603. The results show the similarity of structure between the complex in solution and in the crystal.},

Previous studies have revealed that a surface-located region in the N-terminal domain of the thermolysin-like protease produced by Bacillus stearothermophilus is crucial for thermal stability. In this region a disulfide bridge between residues 8 and 60 was designed by molecular modelling, and the corresponding single and double cysteine mutants were constructed. The disulfide bridge was spontaneously formed in vivo and resulted in a drastic stabilization of the enzyme. This stabilization presents one of the very few examples of successful stabilization of a broad specificity protease by a designed disulfide bond. We propose that the success of the present stabilization strategy is the result of the localization and mutation of an area of the molecule involved in the partial unfolding processes that determine thermal stability.},

   Title = {Assessment of comparative modeling in CASP2},
   Journal = {Proteins},
   Volume = {Suppl},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {14-28.},
   Abstract = {An assessment is presented for all submissions to the comparative modeling challenge in the 1996 Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP2). Of the original 12 target structures, 9 were solved prior to the meeting: 8 by X-ray crystallography and 1 by NMR spectroscopy. These targets varied over a large range of difficulty, as assessed by the percentage sequence identity with the principal parent structure, which ranged from 20% up to 85%. The overall quality of the models reflected the similarity of the principal parent. As expected, when the sequence alignment was correct, the core was accurately modeled, with the largest deviations occurring in the loops. Models were built which gave C alpha root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) compared with the observed structure of < 1 A for targets with high parental similarity; even at 26% sequence identity, the best model structures had C alpha deviations of only 2.2 A. Overall, these deviations are comparable with those observed between the parent structure and the target, but locally there are several examples where the model approaches closer to the target than does the parent. There were three targets below 25% sequence identity, and the models generated for these targets were, in general, significantly less accurate. This principally reflects errors in the alignment which, if systematically shifted, can generate C alpha RMSDs > 18 A. Compared with CASP1, the geometry of the models was significantly improved with no D-amino acids. By far the major contribution to RMSD error was the alignment accuracy, which varied from 100% down to 7% over the range of targets. In the structurally variable regions, global shifts, caused by hinge bending, were the major source of error, giving significantly lower local RMSDs than global RMSDs. In over 50% of these noncore regions, the difference between global and local RMSDs was more than 3 A, and was as high as 10 A for one structurally variable region. For the side chains, the chi 1 RMSDs are strongly correlated with the C alpha RMSDs. For models with C alpha deviations less than 1 A, on average 78.5% of side chains are placed in the correct rotamer, although the chi 1 RMSDs, though clearly better than random, were disappointing at around 46 degrees. As the backbone deviations increased, the side chain placement became less accurate, with an average chi 1 RMSD of 75 degrees on a 1.5-2.5 A C alpha backbone (average 51.4% correct rotamer). Refinement by energy minimization or molecular dynamics made only minor adjustments to improve local geometry and generally made small, but not significant, improvements to the RMSD. In total, 19 groups submitted 62 models (89 coordinate sets) that could be assessed. Most modelers used manual adjustments to sequence alignments and, in general, good alignments were obtained down to 25% sequence identity. The modeling methods ranged from "classical" modeling, involving core building followed by loop and side chain addition, to more sophisticated approaches based on probability distributions, Monte Carlo sampling or distance geometry. For each target, several groups produced equally good models, given the expected errors in the structures (about 0.5 A). No one method came out as clearly superior, although the approaches that inherit directly from the parents generally performed better than the more radical techniques. However, for each target there were some poor models, usually reflecting a poor sequence alignment, and the range of accuracy for each target is therefore large. Fully automated methods are able to perform very well for "easy" targets (85% sequence identity with parent), but when modeling using a distantly related parent, care and expertise, especially in performing the alignment, still appear to be important factors in generating accurate models.},

   Abstract = {The reliability of ranking of protein structure modeling methods is assessed. The assessment is based on the parametric Student's t test and the nonparametric Wilcox signed rank test of statistical significance of the difference between paired samples. The approach is applied to the ranking of the comparative modeling methods tested at the fourth meeting on Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP). It is shown that the 14 CASP4 test sequences may not be sufficient to reliably distinguish between the top eight methods, given the model quality differences and their standard deviations. We suggest that CASP needs to be supplemented by an assessment of protein structure prediction methods that is automated, continuous in time, based on several criteria applied to a large number of models, and with quantitative statistical reliability assigned to each characterization.},

   Abstract = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large- scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

A least- squares fitting algorithm is then used to optimize the fit between the final set of equivalences. We have applied our method to the comparison of ribonucleic acid structures, as well as protein structures. The structural alignments are generally consistent with those previously published. In fact, on most occasions our method defines at least the same number of topological equivalences as other procedures, but always with a lower r.m.s. distance between them.},

Third, the pairwise procedure has been generalized to multiple structure alignment. This implementation of rigid-body superposition can recognize well documented distant relationships which hitherto have required consideration of additional features and properties as well as those relationships between proteins of different sizes. A much larger common scaffold or framework between six globins can be extracted than that obtained using a standard algorithm for multiple structure superposition.},

   Abstract = {The relationship between the preferred side-chain dihedral angles and the secondary structure of a residue was examined. The structures of 61 proteins solved to a resolution of 2.0 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) or better were analysed using a relational database to store the information. The strongest feature observed was that the chi 1 distribution for most side-chains in an alpha-helix showed an absence of the g- conformation and a shift towards the t conformation when compared to the non- alpha/beta structures. The exceptions to this tendency were for short polar side-chains that form hydrogen bonds with the main-chain which prefer g+. Shifts in the chi 1 preferences for residues in the beta- sheet were observed. Other side-chain dihedral angles (chi 2, chi 3, chi 4) were found to be influenced by the main-chain. This paper presents more accurate distributions for the side-chain dihedral angles which were obtained from the increased number of proteins determined to high resolution. The means and standard deviations for chi 1 and chi 2 angles are presented for all residues according to the secondary structure of the main-chain. The means and standard deviations are given for the most popular conformations for side-chains in which chi 3 and chi 4 rotations affect the position of C atoms.},

   Journal = {Protein Sci.},
   Volume = {11},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {430-448.},
   Abstract = {A protein structure model generally needs to be evaluated to assess whether or not it has the correct fold. To improve fold assessment, four types of a residue-level statistical potential were optimized, including distance-dependent, contact, Phi/Psi dihedral angle, and accessible surface statistical potentials. Approximately 10,000 test models with the correct and incorrect folds were built by automated comparative modeling of protein sequences of known structure. The criterion used to discriminate between the correct and incorrect models was the Z-score of the model energy. The performance of a Z-score was determined as a function of many variables in the derivation and use of the corresponding statistical potential. The performance was measured by the fractions of the correctly and incorrectly assessed test models. The most discriminating combination of any one of the four tested potentials is the sum of the normalized distance-dependent and accessible surface potentials. The distance-dependent potential that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses both C(alpha) and C(beta) atoms as interaction centers, distinguishes between all 20 standard residue types, has the distance range of 30 A, and is derived and used by taking into account the sequence separation of the interacting atom pairs. The terms for the sequentially local interactions are significantly less informative than those for the sequentially nonlocal interactions. The accessible surface potential that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses C(beta) atoms as interaction centers and distinguishes between all 20 standard residue types. The performance of the tested statistical potentials is not likely to improve significantly with an increase in the number of known protein structures used in their derivation. The parameters of fold assessment whose optimal values vary significantly with model size include the size of the known protein structures used to derive the potential and the distance range of the accessible surface potential. Fold assessment by statistical potentials is most difficult for the very small models. This difficulty presents a challenge to fold assessment in large-scale comparative modeling, which produces many small and incomplete models. The results described in this study provide a basis for an optimal use of statistical potentials in fold assessment.},

   Journal = {Proteins},
   Volume = {37},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {530-543.},
   Abstract = {Side-chain modeling has a widespread application in many current methods for protein tertiary structure determination, prediction, and design. Of the existing side-chain modeling methods, rotamer-based methods are the fastest and most efficient. Classically, a rotamer is conceived as a single, rigid conformation of an amino acid sidechain. Here, we present a flexible rotamer model in which a rotamer is a continuous ensemble of conformations that cluster around the classic rigid rotamer. We have developed a thermodynamically based method for calculating effective energies for the flexible rotamer. These energies have a one-to-one correspondence with the potential energies of the rigid rotamer. Therefore, the flexible rotamer model is completely general and may be used with any rotamer-based method in substitution of the rigid rotamer model. We have compared the performance of the flexible and rigid rotamer models with one side-chain modeling method in particular (the self-consistent mean field theory method) on a set of 20 high quality crystallographic protein structures. For the flexible rotamer model, we obtained average predictions of 85.8% for chi1, 76.5% for chi1+2 and 1.34 A for root-mean-square deviation (RMSD); the corresponding values for core residues were 93.0%, 87.7% and 0.70 A, respectively. These values represent improvements of 7.3% for chi1, 8.1% for chi1+2 and 0.23 A for RMSD over the predictions obtained with the rigid rotamer model under otherwise identical conditions; the corresponding improvements for core residues were 6.9%, 10.5% and 0.43 A, respectively. We found that the predictions obtained with the flexible rotamer model were also significantly better than those obtained for the same set of proteins with another state-of-the- art side-chain placement method in the literature, especially for core residues. The flexible rotamer model represents a considerable improvement over the classic rigid rotamer model. It can, therefore, be used with considerable advantage in all rotamer-based methods commonly applied to protein tertiary structure determination, prediction, and design and also in predictions of free energies in mutational studies.},

We have developed a set of tools for launching and analyzing many independent docking jobs in parallel on a heterogeneous network of UNIX-based workstations. This paper describes the current release, and the results of a suite of diverse test systems. We also present the results of a systematic investigation into the effects of varying simulated-annealing parameters on molecular docking. We show that even for ligands with a large number of degrees of freedom, root- mean-square deviations of less than 1 A from the crystallographic conformation are obtained for the lowest-energy dockings, although fewer dockings find the crystallographic conformation when there are more degrees of freedom.},

   Abstract = {The free energy landscapes of peptide conformations in water have been observed by the enhanced conformational sampling method, applying the selectively enhanced multicanonical molecular dynamics simulations. The conformations of the peptide dimers, -Gly-Gly-, -Gly-Ala-, -Gly-Ser-, - Ala-Gly-, -Asn-Gly-, -Pro-Gly-, -Pro-Ala-, and -Ala-Ala-, which were all blocked with N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal N-methyl groups, were individually sampled with the explicit TIP3P water molecules. From each simulation trajectory, we obtained the canonical ensemble at 300 K, from which the individual three-dimensional landscape was drawn by the potential of mean force using the three reaction coordinates: the backbone dihedral angle, psi, of the first amino acid, the backbone dihedral angle, phi, of the second amino acid, and the distance between the carbonyl oxygen of the N-terminal acetyl group and the C-terminal amide proton. The most stable state and several meta-stable states correspond to extended conformations and typical beta-turn conformations, and their free energy values were accounted for from the potentials of mean force at the states. In addition, the contributions from the intra-molecular energies of peptides and those from the hydration effects were analyzed. Consequently, the stable beta-turn conformations in the free energy landscape were consistent with the empirically preferred beta-turn types for each amino acid sequence. The thermodynamic values for the hydration effect were decomposed and they correlated well with the empirical values estimated from the solvent accessible surface area of each molecular conformation during the trajectories. The origin of the architecture of protein local fragments was analyzed from the viewpoint of the free energy and its decomposed factors.},

   Abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

   Abstract = {We introduce a method of homology modeling consisting of database searches and simulated annealing. All processes involving searches for homologous proteins, alignment, the construction of Calpha atoms, construction of main-chain atoms, and the construction of side-chain atoms are performed automatically. In this method, main-chain conformations are generated from the weighted average of mainchain coordinates in reference proteins. The weight is defined by the local space homology representing the similarity of environmental residues at topologically equivalent positions in reference proteins. Side-chain conformations are generated for constructed main-chain atoms by database searches, and main-chain atoms are optimized for the fixed side-chain conformations. These two processes, i.e., the side-chain generation and main-chain optimization, are repeated several times. This type of construction provides a structure similar to the x-ray structure, in particular, for main-chain and side-chain atoms in the residues belonging to structurally conserved regions (SCRs). The accuracy of our method was evaluated for 14 proteins whose structures are known. The average root mean square deviation between models and x- ray structures was 2.29 A for all atoms, and the percentage of chi1 angles within 30 degrees was 72.6% for SCRs residues. Some models were in good agreement with their respective x-ray structures. Our method, which has the advantage of being automated, gives results similar to, or better than, published results for three widely used test proteins. Our software, FAMS, is available on the World Wide Web.},

   Abstract = {Conformational clusters and consensus sequences for protein loops have been derived by computational analysis of their structures in a non- redundant set of 233 proteins with less than 25% sequence homology (X- ray resolution better than 2.5 A). Loops have been classified into five types (alpha-alpha, beta-beta links, beta-beta hairpins, alpha-beta and beta-alpha) according to the secondary structures they embrace. Four variables have been used to describe the loop geometry, three angles and one distance between the secondary structure elements embracing the loop. Ramachandran angles (phi, psi) are used to define the loop conformations within each brace geometry. All loops from the non- redundant set have been clustered by means of these geometric features. A total of 56 classes (9 alpha-alpha, 11 beta-beta links, 14 beta-beta hairpins, 13 alpha-beta and 9 beta-alpha) were identified with consensus Ramachandran angles in the loops. These classes were divided into subclasses based on the brace geometry. This clustering procedure captures most of the clusters analysed by predominantly visual inspection methods and finds other clusters that have hitherto not been described. Consensus sequence patterns were identified for the subclasses. An extensive characterisation of loop conformations has therefore been achieved and the computational approach is readily open to the incorporation of information from newly determined structures. These clusters should also enhance model building by comparison studies.},

   Abstract = {A computer-based algorithm was used to cluster the loops forming the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the heavy chain (H3) into canonical classes. Previous analyses of the three-dimensional structures of CDR loops (also known as the hypervariable regions) within antibody immunoglobulin variable domains have shown that for five of the six CDRs there are only a few main-chain conformations (known as canonical forms) that show clear relationships between sequence and structure. However, the larger variation in length and conformation of loops within H3 has limited the classification of these loops into canonical forms. The clustering procedure presented here is based on aligning the Ramachandran-coded main-chain conformation of the residues using a dynamic algorithm that allows the insertion of gaps to obtain an optimum alignment. A total of 41 H3 loops out of 62 non- identical loops, extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, have been automatically grouped into 22 clusters. Inspection of the clusters for consensus sequences or intra-loop interactions or invariant conformation led to the proposal of 13 canonical forms representing 31 loops. These canonical forms include a consideration of the geometry of both the take-off region adjacent to the bracing beta-strands and the remaining loop apex. Subsequently a new set of 15 H3 loops not included in the initial analysis was considered. The clustering procedure was repeated and nine of these 15 loops could be assigned to original clusters, including seven to canonical forms. A sequence profile was generated for each canonical form from the original set of loops and matched against the sequences of the new H3 loops. For five out of the seven new H3 loops that were in a canonical form, the correct form was identified at first rank by this predictive scheme.},

   Journal = {Structure},
   Volume = {5},
   Number = {8},
   Pages = {1093-1108.},
   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein evolution gives rise to families of structurally related proteins, within which sequence identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated relationships in known structures and in optimal cases function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast evaluation of protein structures. RESULTS: We present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four main levels of our classification are protein class (C), architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is considered, such that members of the same architecture might have quite different topologies. When structures belonging to the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous superfamily. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the structural families generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A database of well- characterised protein structure families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of structure-function/evolution relationships to both known and newly determined protein structures.},

   Abstract = {The sequences of related proteins can diverge beyond the point where their relationship can be recognised by pairwise sequence comparisons. In attempts to overcome this limitation, methods have been developed that use as a query, not a single sequence, but sets of related sequences or a representation of the characteristics shared by related sequences. Here we describe an assessment of three of these methods: the SAM-T98 implementation of a hidden Markov model procedure; PSI- BLAST; and the intermediate sequence search (ISS) procedure. We determined the extent to which these procedures can detect evolutionary relationships between the members of the sequence database PDBD40-J. This database, derived from the structural classification of proteins (SCOP), contains the sequences of proteins of known structure whose sequence identities with each other are 40% or less. The evolutionary relationships that exist between those that have low sequence identities were found by the examination of their structural details and, in many cases, their functional features. For nine false positive predictions out of a possible 432,680, i.e. at a false positive rate of about 1/50,000, SAM-T98 found 35% of the true homologous relationships in PDBD40-J, whilst PSI-BLAST found 30% and ISS found 25%. Overall, this is about twice the number of PDBD40-J relations that can be detected by the pairwise comparison procedures FASTA (17%) and GAP- BLAST (15%). For distantly related sequences in PDBD40-J, those pairs whose sequence identity is less than 30%, SAM-T98 and PSI-BLAST detect three times the number of relationships found by the pairwise methods.},

FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

   Abstract = {Ab initio folding simulations have been performed on three peptides, using a genetic algorithm-based search method which operates on a full atom representation. Conformations are evaluated with an empirical force field parameterized by a potential of mean force analysis of experimental structures. The dominant terms in the force field are local and nonlocal main chain electrostatics and the hydrophobic effect. Two of the simulated structures were for fragments of complete proteins (eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and the subtilisin propeptide) that were identified as being likely initiation sites for folding. The experimental structure of one of these (EDN) was subsequently found to be consistent with that prediction (using local hydrophobic burial as the determinant for independent folding). The simulations of the structures of these two peptides were only partly successful. The most successful folding simulation was that of a 22- residue peptide corresponding to the membrane binding domain of blood coagulation factor VIII (Membind). Three simulations were performed on this peptide and the lowest energy conformation was found to be the most similar to the experimental structure. The conformation of this peptide was determined with a C alpha rms deviation of 4.4 A. Although these simulations were partly successful there are still many unresolved problems, which we expect to be able to address in the next structure prediction experiment.},

   Number = {5},
   Pages = {1161-1175.},
   Abstract = {Non-rotameric ("off-rotamer") conformations are commonly observed for the side-chains of protein crystal structures. This study examines whether such conformations are real or artifactual by comparing the energetics of on and off-rotamer side-chain conformations calculated with the CHARMM energy function. Energy-based predictions of side-chain orientation are carried out by rigid-geometry mapping in the presence of the fixed protein environment for 1709 non-polar side-chains in 24 proteins for which high-resolution (2.0 A or better) structures are available. For on-rotamer conformations, 97.6 % are correctly predicted; i.e. they correspond to the absolute minima of their local side-chain energy maps (generally to within 10 degrees or less). By contrast, for the observed off-rotamer side-chain conformations, 63.8 % are predicted correctly. This difference is statistically significant (P<0.001) and suggests that while most of the observed off-rotamer conformations are real, many of the erroneously predicted ones are likely to be artifacts of the X-ray refinements. Probabilities for off- rotamer conformations of the non-polar side-chains are calculated to be 5.0-6.1 % by adaptive umbrella-sampled molecular dynamics trajectories of individual amino acid residues in vacuum and in the presence of an average protein or aqueous dielectric environment. These results correspond closely to the 5.7 % off-rotamer fraction predicted by the rigid-geometry mapping studies. Since these values are about one-half of the 10.2 % off-rotamer fraction observed in the X-ray structures, they support the conclusion that many of the latter are artifacts. In both the rigid-geometry mapping and the molecular dynamics studies, the discrepancies between the predicted and observed fractions of off- rotamer conformations are largest for leucine residues (approximately 6 % versus 16.6 %). The simulations for the isolated amino acid residues indicate that the real off-rotamer frequency of 5-6 % is consistent with the internal side-chain and local side-chain-backbone energetics and does not originate from shifts due to the protein. The present results suggest that energy-based rotation maps can be used to find side-chain positional artifacts that appear in crystal structures based on refinements in the 2 A resolution range.},

   Abstract = {Using information from sequence alignments significantly improves protein secondary structure prediction. Typically, more divergent profiles yield better predictions. Recently, various groups have shown that accuracy can be improved significantly by using PSI-BLAST profiles to develop new prediction methods. Here, we focused on the influences of various alignment strategies on two 8-year-old PHD methods. The following results stood out. (i) PHD using pairwise alignments predicts about 72% of all residues correctly in one of the three states: helix, strand, and other. Using larger databases and PSI-BLAST raised accuracy to 75%. (ii) More than 60% of the improvement originated from the growth of current sequence databases; about 20% resulted from detailed changes in the alignment procedure (substitution matrix, thresholds, and gap penalties). Another 20% of the improvement resulted from carefully using iterated PSI-BLAST searches. (iii) It is of interest that we failed to improve prediction accuracy further when attempting to refine the alignment by dynamic programming (MaxHom and ClustalW). (iv) Improvement through family growth appears to saturate at some point. However, most families have not reached this saturation. Hence, we anticipate that prediction accuracy will continue to rise with database growth.},

   Abstract = {We have devised a Cartesian combination operator and coding scheme for improving the performance of genetic algorithms applied to the protein folding problem.

The recombination of the genes of the parents is accomplished by: (1) a rigid superposition of one parent chain on the other, to make the relation of Cartesian coordinates meaningful, then, (2) the chains of the children are formed through a linear combination of the coordinates of their parents. The children produced with this Cartesian combination operator scheme have similar topology and retain the long-range contacts of their parents. The new scheme is significantly more efficient than the standard genetic algorithm methods for locating low-energy conformations of proteins. The considerable superiority of genetic algorithms over Monte Carlo optimization methods is also demonstrated. We have also devised a new dynamic programming lattice fitting procedure for use with the Cartesian combination operator method. The procedure finds excellent fits of real-space chains to the lattice while satisfying bond-length, bond-angle, and overlap constraints.},

Hence, attempts have been made to improve the predicted model of alpha 1-PT by limited molecular dynamics using both AMBER and XPLOR. With molecular dynamics, the previously predicted incorrect turn region reverts to the correct conformation as seen in the X-ray refined structure. In contrast to the model which is not subjected to molecular dynamics, the improved model refines with the X-ray data of alpha 1-PT in fewer cycles, without any manual rebuilding and with comparable or better refinement statistics. Also, the improved model serves as a better starting model in the determination of the structure with the molecular replacement methods.},

   Abstract = {By exhaustive structural comparisons, we have found that about one- third of the alpha-helix-turn-beta-strand polypeptides in alpha-beta barrel domains share a common structural motif. The chief characteristics of this motif are that first, the geometry of the turn between the alpha-helix and the beta-strand is somewhat constrained, and second, the beta-strand contains a hydrophobic patch that fits into a hydrophobic pocket on the alpha-helix. The geometry of the turn does not seem to be a major determinant of the alpha-beta unit, because the turns vary in length from four to six residues. However, the motif does not occur when there are few constraints on the geometry of the turn- for instance, when the turns between the alpha-helix and the beta- strands are very long. It also occurs much less frequently in flat- sheet alpha-beta proteins, where the topology is much less regular and the amount of twist on the sheet varies considerably more than in the barrel proteins. The motif may be one of the basic building blocks from which alpha-beta barrels are constructed.},

   Abstract = {It has been proposed that the architecture of protein domains has evolved by the combinatorial assembly and/or exchange of smaller polypeptide segments. To investigate this proposal, we fused DNA encoding the N-terminal half of a beta-barrel domain (from cold shock protein CspA) with fragmented genomic Escherichia coli DNA and cloned the repertoire of chimeric polypeptides for display on filamentous bacteriophage. Phage displaying folded polypeptides were selected by proteolysis; in most cases the protease-resistant chimeric polypeptides comprised genomic segments in their natural reading frames. Although the genomic segments appeared to have no sequence homologies with CspA, one of the originating proteins had the same fold as CspA, but another had a different fold. Four of the chimeric proteins were expressed as soluble polypeptides; they formed monomers and exhibited cooperative unfolding. Indeed, one of the chimeric proteins contained a set of very slowly exchanging amides and proved more stable than CspA itself. These results indicate that native-like proteins can be generated directly by combinatorial segment assembly from nonhomologous proteins, with implications for theories of the evolution of new protein folds, as well as providing a means of creating novel domains and architectures in vitro.},

Using the electrostatic energy of the purine ring as a basis for discrimination allows the correct identification of receptors in blind studies with 100% specificity and 94% sensitivity. In a second study, similar methodology is used to investigate the binding of clinically relevant inhibitors (Gleevec, purvalanol A, and hymenialdisine) to a variety of protein kinase targets. Overall, excellent agreement between experimental and predicted preferences for kinase targets is obtained. An important conclusion from the latter study is that homology-modeled structures of putative receptors may reasonably be used as targets for docking when directly solved crystal structures are not available. The prospects for routine application of the methodology as a means of identifying potential side interactions of candidate drugs are discussed.},

   Abstract = {The most reliable methods for predicting protein structure are by way of homologous extension, using structural information from a closely related protein, or by "threading" through a set of predefined protein folds ("inverse folding"). Both sets of methods provide a model for the core of the protein--the structurally conserved secondary structures. Due to the large variability both in sequence and size of the loops that connect these secondary structures, they generally cannot be modeled using these techniques. Loop-closure algorithms are aimed at predicting loop structures, given their end-to-end distance. Various such algorithms have been described, and all have been tested by predicting the structure of a single loop in a known protein. In this paper we propose a method, which is based on the bond-scaling- relaxation loop-closure algorithm, for simultaneously predicting the structures of multiple loops, and demonstrate that, for two spatially close loops, simultaneous closure invariably leads to more accurate predictions than sequential closure. The accuracy of the predictions obtained for pairs of loops in the size range of 5-7 residues each is comparable to that obtained by other methods, when predicting the structures of single loops: the RMS deviations from the native conformations of various test cases modeled are approximately 0.6-1.7 A for backbone atoms and 1.1-3.3 A for all-atoms.},

   Abstract = {Homology modelling, currently, is the only theoretical tool which can successfully predict protein 3D structure. As 3D structure is conserved in sequence families, homology modelling allows to predict 3D structure for 20% of SWISSPROT. 20% of the proteins in PDB are remote homologues to another PDB protein. Threading techniques attempt to predict such remote homologues based on sequence information. Here, a new threading method is presented. First, for a list of PDB proteins, 3D structure was projected onto 1D strings of secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Then, secondary structure and accessibility were predicted by neural network systems (PHD). Finally, the predicted and observed 1D strings were aligned by dynamic programming. The resulting alignment was used to detect remote 3D homologues. Four results stand out. Firstly, even for an optimal prediction (assignment based on known structure), only about half the hits that ranked above a given threshold were correctly identified as remote homologues; only about 25% of the first hits were correct. Secondly, real predictions (PHD) were not much worse: about 20% of the first hits were correct. Thirdly, a simple filtering procedure improved prediction performance to about 30% correct first hits. The correct hit ranked among the first three for more than 23 out of 46 cases. Fourthly, the combination of the 1D threading and sequence alignments markedly improved the performance of the threading method TOPITS for some selected cases.},

   Pages = {595-608.},
   Abstract = {The level of sequence similarity that implies similarity in protein structure is well established. Recently, many groups proposed thresholds for similarity in sequence implying similarity in enzymatic function. All previous results suggest the strong conservation of enzymatic function above levels of 50% pairwise sequence identity. Here, I argue that all groups substantially overestimated the conservation of enzyme function because their data sets were either too biased, or too small. An unbiased analysis suggested that less than 30% of the pair fragments above 50% sequence identity have entirely identical EC numbers. Another surprising finding was that even BLAST E- values below 10(-50) did not suffice to automatically transfer enzyme function without errors. As expected, most misclassifications originated from similarities in relatively short regions and/or from transferring annotations for different domains. Both problems cannot be corrected easily by adjusting the thresholds for automatic transfer of genome annotations. A score relating sequence identity to alignment length (distance from HSSP-threshold) outperformed statistical BLAST scores for high sequence similarity. In particular, the distance score allowed error-free transfer of enzyme function for the 10% most similar enzyme pairs. The results illustrated how difficult it is to assess the conservation of protein function and to guarantee error-free genome annotations, in general: sets with millions of pair comparisons might not suffice to arrive at statistically significant conclusions. In practice, the revised detailed estimates for the sequence conservation of enzyme function may provide important benchmarks for everyday sequence analysis and for more cautious automatic genome annotations.},

   Abstract = {An algorithm is presented for the accurate and rapid generation of multiple protein sequence alignments from tertiary structure comparisons. A preliminary multiple sequence alignment is performed using sequence information, which then determines an initial superposition of the structures. A structure comparison algorithm is applied to all pairs of proteins in the superimposed set and a similarity tree calculated. Multiple sequence alignments are then generated by following the tree from the branches to the root. At each branchpoint of the tree, a structure-based sequence alignment and coordinate transformations are output, with the multiple alignment of all structures output at the root. The algorithm encoded in STAMP (STructural Alignment of Multiple Proteins) is shown to give alignments in good agreement with published structural accounts within the dehydrogenase fold domains, globins, and serine proteinases. In order to reduce the need for visual verification, two similarity indices are introduced to determine the quality of each generated structural alignment. Sc quantifies the global structural similarity between pairs or groups of proteins, whereas Pij' provides a normalized measure of the confidence in the alignment of each residue. STAMP alignments have the quality of each alignment characterized by Sc and Pij' values and thus provide a reproducible resource for studies of residue conservation within structural motifs.},

   Pages = {423-439.},
   Abstract = {An analysis was performed on 335 pairs of structurally aligned proteins derived from the structural classification of proteins (SCOP http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/) database. These similarities were divided into analogues, defined as proteins with similar three- dimensional structures (same SCOP fold classification) but generally with different functions and little evidence of a common ancestor (different SCOP superfamily classification). Homologues were defined as pairs of similar structures likely to be the result of evolutionary divergence (same superfamily) and were divided into remote, medium and close sub-divisions based on the percentage sequence identity. Particular attention was paid to the differences between analogues and remote homologues, since both types of similarities are generally undetectable by sequence comparison and their detection is the aim of fold recognition methods. Distributions of sequence identities and substitution matrices suggest a higher degree of sequence similarity in remote homologues than in analogues. Matrices for remote homologues show similarity to existing mutation matrices, providing some validity for their use in previously described fold recognition methods. In contrast, matrices derived from analogous proteins show little conservation of amino acid properties beyond broad conservation of hydrophobic or polar character. Secondary structure and accessibility were more conserved on average in remote homologues than in analogues, though there was no apparent difference in the root-mean-square deviation between these two types of similarities. Alignments of remote homologues and analogues show a similar number of gaps, openings (one or more sequential gaps) and inserted/deleted secondary structure elements, and both generally contain more gaps/openings/deleted secondary structure elements than medium and close homologues. These results suggest that gap parameters for fold recognition should be more lenient than those used in sequence comparison. Parameters were derived from the analogue and remote homologue datasets for potential used in fold recognition methods. Implications for protein fold recognition and evolution are discussed.},

   Pages = {779-815.},
   Abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main- chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

   Pages = {287-302.},
   Abstract = {The interconnected nature of interactions in protein structures appears to be the major hurdle in preventing the construction of accurate comparative models. We present an algorithm that uses graph theory to handle this problem. Each possible conformation of a residue in an amino acid sequence is represented using the notion of a node in a graph. Each node is given a weight based on the degree of the interaction between its side-chain atoms and the local main-chain atoms. Edges are then drawn between pairs of residue conformations/nodes that are consistent with each other (i.e. clash- free and satisfying geometrical constraints). The edges are weighted based on the interactions between the atoms of the two nodes. Once the entire graph is constructed, all the maximal sets of completely connected nodes (cliques) are found using a clique-finding algorithm. The cliques with the best weights represent the optimal combinations of the various main-chain and side-chain possibilities, taking the respective environments into account. The algorithm is used in a comparative modeling scenario to build side-chains, regions of main chain, and mix and match between different homologs in a context- sensitive manner. The predictive power of this method is assessed by applying it to cases where the experimental structure is not known in advance.},

   Abstract = {The database of known protein three-dimensional structures can be significantly increased by the use of sequence homology, based on the following observations. (1) The database of known sequences, currently at more than 12,000 proteins, is two orders of magnitude larger than the database of known structures. (2) The currently most powerful method of predicting protein structures is model building by homology. (3) Structural homology can be inferred from the level of sequence similarity. (4) The threshold of sequence similarity sufficient for structural homology depends strongly on the length of the alignment. Here, we first quantify the relation between sequence similarity, structure similarity, and alignment length by an exhaustive survey of alignments between proteins of known structure and report a homology threshold curve as a function of alignment length. We then produce a database of homology-derived secondary structure of proteins (HSSP) by aligning to each protein of known structure all sequences deemed homologous on the basis of the threshold curve. For each known protein structure, the derived database contains the aligned sequences, secondary structure, sequence variability, and sequence profile. Tertiary structures of the aligned sequences are implied, but not modeled explicitly. The database effectively increases the number of known protein structures by a factor of five to more than 1800. The results may be useful in assessing the structural significance of matches in sequence database searches, in deriving preferences and patterns for structure prediction, in elucidating the structural role of conserved residues, and in modeling three-dimensional detail by homology.},

Recent studies have shown that this is not always the case and there can exist short stretches of high local identity which is not reflected in the structure based alignment. An analysis is presented of 290 pairs of homologous proteins with a view to quantifying the occurrence of these misleading local sequence alignments (MLSAs). It is found that such MLSAs are likely if the global sequence identity is less than 40% and can occur even when it is greater than 60%.

The modifications we consider novel improve the ROC score from 0.758 +/- 0.005 to 0.895 +/- 0.003. This does not include the benefits from four modifications we included in the 'baseline' version, even though they were not implemented in PSI- BLAST version 2.0. The improvement in accuracy was confirmed on a small second test set. This test involved analyzing three protein families with curated lists of true positives from the non-redundant protein database. The modification that accounts for the majority of the improvement is the use, for each database sequence, of a position- specific scoring system tuned to that sequence's amino acid composition. The use of composition-based statistics is particularly beneficial for large-scale automated applications of PSI-BLAST.},

   Journal = {J.Mol.Biol.},
   Volume = {307},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {407-427.},
   Abstract = {Due to the abundant sequence information available from genome projects, an increasing number of structurally unknown proteins, homologous to examples of known 3D structure, will be discovered as new targets for drug design. Since homology models do not provide sufficient accuracy to apply common drug design tools, a new approach, DragHome, has been developed to dock ligands into such approximate protein models. DragHome combines information from homology modelling with ligand data, used by and derived from 3D quantitative structure- activity relationships (QSAR). The binding-site of a model-built protein is analysed in terms of putative ligand interaction sites and translated via Gaussian functions into a functional binding-site description represented by physico-chemical properties. Ligands to be docked onto these binding-site representations are similarly translated into a description based on Gaussian functions. The docking is computed by optimising the overlap between the functional description of the binding site and the ligand, generating multiple solutions. For a set of different ligands, these solutions are ranked according to the internal similarity consistance among the various ligands in the binding modes obtained from docking. DragHome has been validated at examples for which crystal structures are available: structurally distinct thrombin inhibitors were docked onto models of thrombin generated from serine proteases of 28 to 40 % sequence identity, yielding ligand binding modes with an average RMS deviation of 1.4 A. Mostly the near-native solutions are ranked best. Molecular flexibility of ligands can be considered in terms of pre-calculated multiple conformers. DragHome has been used to automatically generate an alignment of 88 thrombin inhibitors, for which a significant 3D QSAR model could be derived. The contribution maps resulting from this analysis can be interpreted with respect to the surrounding protein model. They highlight inconsistencies and deficiencies present in the model. In future developments, this information could be fed back into a subsequent modelling step to improve the protein model.},

   Abstract = {FUGUE, a program for recognizing distant homologues by sequence- structure comparison (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/fugue/), has three key features.

Substitutions of an amino acid in a protein structure are constrained by its local structural environment, which can be defined in terms of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and hydrogen bonding status. The environment-specific substitution tables have been derived from structural alignments in the HOMSTRAD database (http://www- cryst.bioc. cam.ac.uk/homstrad/). (2) Automatic selection of alignment algorithm with detailed structure-dependent gap penalties. FUGUE uses the global-local algorithm to align a sequence-structure pair when they greatly differ in length and uses the global algorithm in other cases. The gap penalty at each position of the structure is determined according to its solvent accessibility, its position relative to the secondary structure elements (SSEs) and the conservation of the SSEs. (3) Combined information from both multiple sequences and multiple structures. FUGUE is designed to align multiple sequences against multiple structures to enrich the conservation/variation information. We demonstrate that the combination of these three key features implemented in FUGUE improves both homology recognition performance and alignment accuracy.},

   Abstract = {A new algorithm is reported which builds an alignment between two protein structures. The algorithm involves a combinatorial extension (CE) of an alignment path defined by aligned fragment pairs (AFPs) rather than the more conventional techniques using dynamic programming and Monte Carlo optimization. AFPs, as the name suggests, are pairs of fragments, one from each protein, which confer structure similarity. AFPs are based on local geometry, rather than global features such as orientation of secondary structures and overall topology. Combinations of AFPs that represent possible continuous alignment paths are selectively extended or discarded thereby leading to a single optimal alignment. The algorithm is fast and accurate in finding an optimal structure alignment and hence suitable for database scanning and detailed analysis of large protein families. The method has been tested and compared with results from Dali and VAST using a representative sample of similar structures. Several new structural similarities not detected by these other methods are reported. Specific one-on-one alignments and searches against all structures as found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) can be performed via the Web at http://cl.sdsc.edu/ce.html.},

The five structures submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately 25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging: highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0 A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8 A. These results suggest that ab initio methods may soon become useful for low-resolution structure prediction for proteins that lack a close homologue of known structure.},

   Abstract = {We explore the ability of a simple simulated annealing procedure to assemble native-like structures from fragments of unrelated protein structures with similar local sequences using Bayesian scoring functions. Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native- like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

The 125 fold recognition groups were assessed by a total score that summarizes their performance over all targets and a quality score reflecting the average quality of the submitted models. Most of the top-performing groups achieved respectable results on both scores simultaneously. Several groups submitted models that were much closer to the respective target structures than any of the known folds in the Protein Data Bank. The CASP4 assessment included the automated servers of the parallel CAFASP experiment. For the total score, the highest rank achieved by a fully automated server is 12.

   Volume = {18},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {119-132.},
   Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the problem of including solvation free energies in evaluating the relative stabilities of loops in proteins. A conformational search based on a gas-phase potential function is used to generate a large number of trial conformations. As has been found previously, the energy minimization step in this process tends to pack charged and polar side chains against the protein surface, resulting in conformations which are unstable in the aqueous phase. Various solvation models can easily identify such structures. In order to provide a more severe test of solvation models, gas-phase conformations were generated in which side chains were kept extended so as to maximize their interaction with the solvent. The free energies of these conformations were compared to that calculated for the crystal structure in three loops of the protein E. coli RNase H, with lengths of 7, 8, and 9 residues. Free energies were evaluated with a finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) calculation for electrostatics and a surface area-based term for nonpolar contributions. These were added to a gas-phase potential function. A free energy function based on atomic solvation parameters was also tested. Both functions were quite successful in selecting, based on a free energy criterion, conformations quite close to the crystal structure for two of the three loops. For one loop, which is involved in crystal contacts, conformations that are quite different from the crystal structure were also selected. A method to avoid precision problems associated with using the FDPB method to evaluate conformational free energies in proteins is described.},

   Abstract = {An approach is described for modelling the three-dimensional structure of a protein from the tertiary structures of several homologous proteins that have been determined by X-ray analysis. A method is developed for the simultaneous superposition of several protein molecules and for the calculation of an 'average structure' or 'framework'. Investigation of the convergence properties of this method, in the case of both weighted and unweighted least squares, demonstrates that both give a unique answer and the latter is robust for an homologous family of proteins. Multi-dimensional scaling is used to subgroup of the proteins with respect to structural homology. The framework calculated on the basis of the family of homologous proteins, or of an appropriate subgroup, is used to align fragments of the known protein structures of high sequence homology with the unknown. This alignment provides a basis for model building the tertiary structure. Different techniques for using the framework to model the mainchain of various globins and an immunoglobulin domain in the structurally conserved regions are investigated.},

   Abstract = {The analysis of protein structure using secondary structure line segments has been widely used in many structure analysis and prediction methods over the past 20 years. Its use in methods that compare protein structures at this level of representation is becoming more important as an increasing number of protein structures become determined through structural genomic programmes. The standard method used to define line segments is to fit an axis through each secondary structure element. This approach has difficulties, however, both with inconsistent definitions of secondary structure and the problem of fitting a single straight line to a bent structure. The procedure described here avoids these problems by finding a set of line segments independently of any external secondary structure definition. This allows the segments to be used as a novel basis for secondary structure definition by taking the average rise/residue along each axis to characterise the segment. This practice has the advantage that secondary structures are described by a single (continuous) value that is not restricted to the conventional classes of alpha-helix, 310 and beta-strand. This latter property allows structures without "classic" secondary structures to be encoded as line segments that can be used in comparison algorithms. When compared over a large number of pairs of homologous proteins, the current method was found to be slightly more consistent than a widely used method based on hydrogen bonds.},

   Abstract = {Protein engineering experiments have been carried out with loop-1 of monomeric triosephosphate isomerase (monoTIM). Loop-1 of monoTIM is disordered in every crystal structure of liganded monoTIM, but in the wild-type TIM it is a very rigid dimer interface loop. This loop connects the first beta-strand with the first alpha-helix of the TIM- barrel scaffold. The first residue of this loop, Lys13, is a conserved catalytic residue. The protein design studies with loop-1 were aimed at rigidifying this loop such that the Lys13 side chain points in the same direction as seen in wild type. The modelling suggested that the loop should be made one residue shorter. With the modelling package ICM the optimal sequence of a new seven-residue loop-1 was determined and its structure was predicted. The new variant could be expressed and purified and has been characterized. The catalytic activity and stability are very similar to those of monoTIM. The crystal structure (at 2.6 A resolution) shows that the experimental loop-1 structure agrees well with the modelled loop-1 structure. The direct superposition of the seven loop residues of the modelled and experimental structures results in an r.m.s. difference of 0.5 A for the 28 main chain atoms. The good agreement between the predicted structure and the crystal structure shows that the described modelling protocol can be used successfully for the reliable prediction of loop structures.},

Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available.},

   Abstract = {An adequate description of entire genomes has to include information on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins. Most of these protein structures will be determined by high-throughput modeling procedures. Thus, a structure-based analysis of the network of protein-protein interactions in genomes requires docking methodologies that are capable of dealing with significant structural inaccuracies in the modeled structures of proteins. We present a systematic study of the applicability of our low-resolution docking method to protein models of different accuracies. A representative nonredundant set of 475 cocrystallized protein-protein complexes was used to build an array of models of each protein in the set. A sophisticated procedure was created to generate the models with RMS deviations of 1, 2, 3,., 10 A from the crystal structure. The docking was performed for all the models, and the predictions were compared with the configurations of the original cocrystallized complexes. Statistical analysis showed that the low-resolution docking can determine the gross structural features of protein-protein interactions for a significant percent of complexes of highly inaccurate protein models. Such predictions may serve as starting points for a more detailed structural analysis, as well as complement experimental and computational data on protein-protein interactions obtained by other techniques.},

   Abstract = {A new approach is introduced for analyzing and ultimately predicting protein structures, defined at the level of C alpha coordinates. We analyze hexamers (oligopeptides of six amino acid residues) and show that their structure tends to concentrate in specific clusters rather than vary continuously. Thus, we can use a limited set of standard structural building blocks taken from these clusters as representatives of the repertoire of observed hexamers. We demonstrate that protein structures can be approximated by concatenating such building blocks. We have identified about 100 building blocks by applying clustering algorithms, and have shown that they can "replace" about 76% of all hexamers in well-refined known proteins with an error of less than 1 A, and can be joined together to cover 99% of the residues. After replacing each hexamer by a standard building block with similar conformation, we can approximately reconstruct the actual structure by smoothly joining the overlapping building blocks into a full protein. The reconstructed structures show, in most cases, high resemblance to the original structure, although using a limited number of building blocks and local criteria of concatenating them is not likely to produce a very precise global match. Since these building blocks reflect, in many cases, some sequence dependency, it may be possible to use the results of this study as a basis for a protein structure prediction procedure.},

   Pages = {975-1001.},
   Abstract = {An approach to loop prediction that starts with a database search is presented and analyzed. To obtain meaningful statistics, 130 loops from 21 proteins were studied. The correlation between the internal conformation of the loop and the conformation of the neighboring stem residues was examined. Distances between C(alpha) and C(beta) of the immediate neighbor residues at each end select template loops as well as more complex (e.g. three residues on either side) matching criteria. To have a high probability that the best possible loop candidate in the database is included in the set, relatively large cutoffs for matching the interatomic distances of the stem residues have to be used in the template loop selection procedure; for loops of length 5, this results in an average of 1000 loops and for loops of length 9, the number is about 1500. The required number increases only slowly with loop length, in contrast to the exponential time increase involved in direct searches of the conformational space. The best loops among the large number of candidates can be determined by ranking them with the standard CHARMM non-bonded energy function (without electrostatics) applied to the backbone and C(beta) atoms. The same representation (backbone plus C(beta)) can be used to optimize the loop orientations relative to the rest of the protein by constrained energy minimization. Target loops that have many non-bonded contacts with the protein yield better results so that analysis of the non-bonded contacts of the selected template loops is useful in determining the expected accuracy of a prediction. The method for loop selection and optimization predicted eight (out of 18) loops of up to nine residues to an RMSD better than 1.07 A relative to the crystal structure; for 17 of the 18 loops, one of the three lowest energy template loops had an RMSD of less than 1.79 A. The prediction of antibody loops from a database search is more effective than that for non-antibody loops. Provided that they belong to one of the canonical classes, very similar antibody loops are certain to exist in the database. Superposition of the stem residues for antibody loops also results in a better orientation than with arbitrary target loops because the neighboring residues tend to have a more similar beta-strand structure. Two H3 loops (for which no canonical structures have been proposed) were predicted with reasonable accuracy (RMSD of 0.49 A and 1.07 A) even though no corresponding antibody loops were in the database.},

   Abstract = {Comparative modeling aims at constructing molecular models for proteins of unknown structure, by using known structures of related proteins as templates. To test the comparative modeling approach reported here, predictions for 13 target proteins were submitted during the fourth round of "blind" protein structure prediction experiment (CASP4; http://PredictionCenter.llnl.gov/casp4). Sequence identity between these target proteins and the closest known structures ranged from 13 to 58%, indicating a broad spectrum of prediction difficulty. Although this broad difficulty range required addressing a variety of issues, the most important proved to be sequence-structure alignment for distant homology targets. The alignment step was based on structure- based evaluation of alignment variants produced mainly with PSI-BLAST intermediate sequence search procedure (PSI-BLAST-ISS). Although a fraction of correctly aligned residues in resulting models was markedly better than the average in all cases, for distant homology targets it was still considerably below the estimated achievable level. Results with CASP4 targets show that, along with the correctness of sequence- structure alignments, effective use of multiple template structures may significantly increase accuracy of the model structure. Improvement in this area should also result in more accurate loop modeling and side- chain prediction.},

   Abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

We evaluate different strategies for optimizing information return on effort. The strategy that maximizes structural coverage requires about seven times fewer structure determinations compared with the strategy in which targets are selected at random. With a choice of reasonable model quality and the goal of 90% coverage, we extrapolate the estimate of the total effort of structural genomics. It would take approximately 16,000 carefully selected structure determinations to construct useful atomic models for the vast majority of all proteins. In practice, unless there is global coordination of target selection, the total effort will likely increase by a factor of three. The task can be accomplished within a decade provided that selection of targets is highly coordinated and significant funding is available.},

Ninety percent of the known disease-causing missense mutations examined fit this model, with the vast majority affecting protein stability, through a variety of energy related factors.

   Number = {1},
   Pages = {235-253.},
   Abstract = {An automatic procedure for the classification of short protein fragments, representing turn motifs between two consecutive secondary structures, is presented. This procedure has two steps. Fragments of given length are first grouped on the basis of their backbone dihedral angle values, and then clustered as a function of the root-mean-square deviation of their superimposed backbone atoms. The classification procedure identifies 63 families of turn motifs with at least five members, in a dataset of 141 proteins. A detailed analysis is presented of the ten identified alpha alpha-turn families, of which four correspond to novel motifs. The sequence and structure features that characterize these families are described. It is found that some features are conserved within the fragments belonging to the same family, but their environment in the parent protein varies considerably. N-capping interactions and helix stop signals are encountered in a number of families, where they seem to stabilize the motif conformation. In two families, one with three residues in the loop, and one with four, an appreciable fraction of the members displays both types of characteristic helix end interactions in the same motif. Interestingly, contrary to most other alpha alpha-turns, the relative frequency of these two motifs is much higher than that of short protein segments with the same loop conformation. Furthermore, the family with three residues in the loop includes the helix-turn- helix motif known to bind DNA. It seems to be the only one among the ten identified families that can be related to biological function.},

   Abstract = {The relationship between sequence similarity and structural similarity has been examined in 36 protein families with five or more diverse members whose structures are known. The structural similarity within a family (as determined with the DALI structure comparison program) is linearly related to sequence similarity (as determined by a Smith- Waterman search of the protein sequences in the structure database). The correlation between structural similarity and sequence similarity is very high; 18 of the 36 families had linear correlation coefficients r>/=0.878, and only nine had correlation coefficients r</=0.815. Inclusion of higher-order terms in the structure/sequence relationship improved the fit by less than 7% in 27 of the 36 families. Differences in sequence/structure correlations are distributed evenly among the four protein structural classes, alpha, beta, alpha/beta, and alpha+beta. While most protein families show high correlations between sequence similarity and structural similarity, the amount of structural change per sequence change, i.e. the structural mutation sensitivity, varies almost fourfold. Protein families with high and low structural mutation sensitivity are distributed evenly among protein structure classes. In addition, we did not detect strong correlations between structural mutation sensitivity and either protein family mutation rates or protein size. Our results are more consistent with models of protein structure that encode a protein family's fold throughout the protein sequence, and not just in a few critical residues.},

With the use of a simplified model, we exhaustively enumerate the space of all sequences and the space of all structures, simulate the evolutionary relationship between sequences and structures, and characterize the steady-state sequence distribution for all structures in terms of several thermodynamic variables. We assess the effects of two major forces of evolution: mutation and recombination. Three simplifications are made. First, a two-dimensional lattice model is used to represent protein sequences and structures. Second, proteins undergo neutral evolution so that the fitness landscape has a flat allowed region inside of which all sequences are equally fit. Third, we ignore otherwise important factors such as finite population size and evolutionary time. Two scenarios emerge from our study. The first occurs when evolution is dominated by mutation events. Even though the prototype sequence that is most mutationally robust is preferred by evolution, the preference is not strong enough to offset the huge size of sequence space. Most native sequences are located near the boundary of the fitness region and are marginally compatible with the native structure. The second scenario occurs when evolution is dominated by recombination events. Now evolutionary preference for prototype sequence is strong enough to overcome the size of sequence space so that most native sequences are located near the center of sequence-structure compatibility. We conclude that the relative frequency of mutation and recombination events is a major determinant of how optimal protein sequences are for their structures.},

   Pages = {421-430.},
   Abstract = {Current techniques for the prediction of side-chain conformations on a fixed backbone have an accuracy limit of about 1.0-1.5 A rmsd for core residues. We have carried out a detailed and systematic analysis of the factors that influence the prediction of side-chain conformation and, on this basis, have succeeded in extending the limits of side-chain prediction for core residues to about 0.7 A rmsd from native, and 94 % and 89 % of chi(1) and chi(1+2 ) dihedral angles correctly predicted to within 20 degrees of native, respectively. These results are obtained using a force-field that accounts for only van der Waals interactions and torsional potentials. Prediction accuracy is strongly dependent on the rotamer library used. That is, a complete and detailed rotamer library is essential. The greatest accuracy was obtained with an extensive rotamer library, containing over 7560 members, in which bond lengths and bond angles were taken from the database rather than simply assuming idealized values. Perhaps the most surprising finding is that the combinatorial problem normally associated with the prediction of the side-chain conformation does not appear to be important. This conclusion is based on the fact that the prediction of the conformation of a single side-chain with all others fixed in their native conformations is only slightly more accurate than the simultaneous prediction of all side-chain dihedral angles.},

   Journal = {PNAS},
   Volume = {99},
   Number = {11},
   Pages = {7432-7437.},
   Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a method to account for the shape of the potential energy curve in the evaluation of conformational free energies. The method is based on a procedure that generates a set of conformations, each with its own force-field energy, but adds a term to this energy that favors conformations that are close in structure (have a low rmsd) to other conformations. The sum of the force-field energy and rmsd-dependent term is defined here as the "colony energy" of a given conformation, because each conformation that is generated is viewed as representing a colony of points. The use of the colony energy tends to select conformations that are located in broad energy basins. The approach is applied to the ab initio prediction of the conformations of all of the loops in a dataset of 135 nonredundant proteins. By using an rmsd from a native criterion based on the superposition of loop stems, the average rmsd of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8- residue long loops is 0.85, 0.92, 1.23, and 1.45 A, respectively. For 8- residue loops, 60 of 61 predictions have an rmsd of less than 3.0 A. The use of the colony energy is found to improve significantly the results obtained from the potential function alone.

For each of the eight heptapeptides chosen to represent a variety of protein conformations, 1,000-2,000 conformations were sampled. Each segment contained 14 rotatable backbone dihedral angles. The average root mean square deviations (RMSDs) between the predicted and the native conformations were 0.7 angstrom for the backbone and 1.2 angstroms for the side chain atoms. These predictions were substantially more accurate than the previous predictions (1.1 angstroms for the backbone and 2.2 angstroms for the side chain atoms) of the same eight protein segments based on limited conformational sampling (100 conformations for each segment). Large prediction errors mostly occurred at polar and surface side chains that are unlikely to have any meaningful conformation. Moreover, the reliability of seven of the eight predictions was demonstrated with their energy-RMSD and stability-RMSD correlations of the low-energy conformations, where the conformational stability was estimated by using the multiple copy simultaneous sampling method.},

It is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of human, mouse and other genome sequences, available as either an interactive web site or as flat files. Ensembl also integrates manually annotated gene structures from external sources where available. As well as being one of the leading sources of genome
annotation, Ensembl is an open source software engineering project to develop a
portable system able to handle very large genomes and associated requirements. These range from sequence analysis to data storage and visualisation and installations exist around the world in both companies and at academic sites. With both
human and mouse genome sequences available and more vertebrate sequences to follow, many of the recent developments in Ensembl have focusing on developing automatic comparative genome analysis and visualisation.

Most submissions are made using the BankIt (web) or Sequin programs and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Data exchange with the EMBL Data Library and the DNA Data Bank of Japan helps ensure comprehensive worldwide coverage. GenBank data is accessible through NCBI's integrated retrieval system, Entrez, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain
information, and the biomedical literature via PubMed. Sequence similarity searching is provided by the BLAST family of programs. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. NCBI also offers a wide range of World Wide Web retrieval and analysis services based on GenBank data. The GenBank database and related resources are freely accessible via the NCBI home page at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

abstract = "Plants from wide taxonomic groupings have similar genes and ordering of genes along the chromosomes. However, the repetitive DNA, much of no known function and often constituting the majority of the genome, varies extensively from species to species in absolute amount, sequence and dispersion pattern. Despite this, it is known that families of repeated \{DNA\} motifs each have a characteristic genomic location within a genus, and that there are different constraints on the evolution of repetitive \{DNA\} and genes. There are now enough data about different types of repetitive DNAâfrom sequencing, Southern analysis and in situ hybridizationâto build a model of the organization of a typical plant genome, and apply it to gene cloning, evolutionary studies and gene transfer.
