# Introduction

If you have ever worked on a project, or collaborated with other team members, then you have already created different versions of your document to update it.  

This is a primitive way of the version control because it's manual and not detailed. If we want to figure out the differences between 2 copies just by putting them side-by-side, it will be very time-consuming and super error-prone. 

In this session, you'll be introduced to the concept of version control system (VCS) to maintain a detailed history of the created versions. By using a VCS, we can know when the changes were made and who made them.

We'll be using one of the most popular version control system called [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and show you some of the ways you can use it. 

We'll also learn how to set up an account with the service called [GitHub](https://github.com/), so that you can create your own remote repositories to store your code and data.



# Git Overview

A version control tracks the changes that happen within directories or files.
There are two main types of version control systems:

  + The centralized model:  all users connect to a central, master repository.

  + The distributed model: each user has a copy of entire repository on their computer and these repositroies can easily be synchronized.

Git is distributed VCS, free and open source tool.

## Installation and getting start with Git

Check if your computer has a Git installed by typing the following command line:

```console
osboxes@osboxes:~$ git --version

```

If no version information is shown, you need to install it yourself

```console
osboxes@osboxes:~$ sudo apt-get update
osboxes@osboxes:~$ sudo apt-get install git

```

We have already said that by using VCS we can know which user have made the changes. For this, we need to tell git our identity using the following command lines:

```console
osboxes@osboxes:~$ git config --global user.name "my_name"
osboxes@osboxes:~$ git config --global user.email "name@example.com"

```  


### Setting up a new Git repository

A Git repository (repo) is a directory that contains your project work. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.

To create a new repo, you'll use the `git init` command. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory

```console
osboxes@osboxes:~$ mkdir my_project 
osboxes@osboxes:~$ cd my_project
osboxes@osboxes:~$ get init
osboxes@osboxes:~$ ls -la #check for the hidden directories
osboxes@osboxes:~$ ls -l  # check the files inside the .git subdirecotry

```

We can see that .git directory contains all the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything.
This is where git records all of the commits and keeps the history of all the changes.



### Clone an existing Repository
To get an identical copy of an existing repository: for example, a project that you would like to contribute to. 
The command you need to create a local copy on your computer is `git clone`

```console
osboxes@osboxes:~$ git clone https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/bioinformatics.git

```
