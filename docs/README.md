# Bioinformatics resources and best-practices for plant breeders

This material is maintained by Najla Ksouri and Bruno Contreras Moreira

##  Summary

Here we review some bioinformatics resources and databases which can be useful in plant breeding and genomics. 
We will use both standalone and Web-based tools and will also review reproducible analysis practices and software benchmarks.
